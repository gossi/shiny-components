component is an isolated piece of UI, represented by a template and an\n    optional class. When a component has a class, its template's `this` value\n    is an instance of the component class.\n  \n    ## Template-only Components\n  \n    The simplest way to create a component is to create a template file in\n    `app/templates/components`. For example, if you name a template\n    `app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs`:\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>{{@person.name}}</h1>\n    <img src={{@person.avatar}}>\n    <p class='signature'>{{@person.signature}}</p>\n    ```\n  \n    You will be able to use `<PersonProfile />` to invoke this component elsewhere\n    in your application:\n  \n    ```app/templates/application.hbs\n    <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} />\n    ```\n  \n    Note that component names are capitalized here in order to distinguish them\n    from regular HTML elements, but they are dasherized in the file system.\n  \n    While the angle bracket invocation form is generally preferred, it is also\n    possible to invoke the same component with the `{{person-profile}}` syntax:\n  \n    ```app/templates/application.hbs\n    {{person-profile person=this.currentUser}}\n    ```\n  \n    Note that with this syntax, you use dashes in the component name and\n    arguments are passed without the `@` sign.\n  \n    In both cases, Ember will render the content of the component template we\n    created above. The end result will be something like this:\n  \n    ```html\n    <h1>Tomster</h1>\n    <img src=\"https://emberjs.com/tomster.jpg\">\n    <p class='signature'>Out of office this week</p>\n    ```\n  \n    ## File System Nesting\n  \n    Components can be nested inside sub-folders for logical groupping. For\n    example, if we placed our template in\n    `app/templates/components/person/short-profile.hbs`, we can invoke it as\n    `<Person::ShortProfile />`:\n  \n    ```app/templates/application.hbs\n    <Person::ShortProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} />\n    ```\n  \n    Or equivalently, `{{person/short-profile}}`:\n  \n    ```app/templates/application.hbs\n    {{person/short-profile person=this.currentUser}}\n    ```\n  \n    ## Yielding Contents\n  \n    You can use `yield` inside a template to include the **contents** of any block\n    attached to the component. The block will be executed in its original context:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>\n      <p>Admin mode</p>\n      {{! Executed in the current context. }}\n    </PersonProfile>\n    ```\n  \n    or\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#person-profile person=this.currentUser}}\n      <p>Admin mode</p>\n      {{! Executed in the current context. }}\n    {{/person-profile}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n    {{yield}}\n    ```\n  \n    ## Customizing Components With JavaScript\n  \n    If you want to customize the component in order to handle events, transform\n    arguments or maintain internal state, you implement a subclass of `Component`.\n  \n    For example, you could implement the action `hello` for the `person-profile`\n    component:\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      actions: {\n        hello(name) {\n          console.log(\"Hello\", name);\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    And then use it in the component's template:\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n    {{yield}} <!-- block contents -->\n    <button {{action 'hello' person.name}}>\n      Say Hello to {{person.name}}\n    </button>\n    ```\n  \n    When the user clicks the button, Ember will invoke the `hello` action,\n    passing in the current value of `person.name` as an argument.\n  \n    For historical reasons, components must have a `-` in their name when invoked\n    using the `{{` syntax.\n  \n    ## Customizing a Component's HTML Element in JavaScript\n  \n    ### HTML Tag\n  \n    The default HTML tag name used for a component's HTML representation is `div`.\n    This can be customized by setting the `tagName` property.\n  \n    Consider the following component class:\n  \n    ```app/components/emphasized-paragraph.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'em'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    When invoked, this component would produce output that looks something like\n    this:\n  \n    ```html\n    <em id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></em>\n    ```\n  \n    ### HTML `class` Attribute\n  \n    The HTML `class` attribute of a component's tag can be set by providing a\n    `classNames` property that is set to an array of strings:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNames: ['my-class', 'my-other-class']\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce output that looks like this:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view my-class my-other-class\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    `class` attribute values can also be set by providing a `classNameBindings`\n    property set to an array of properties names for the component. The return\n    value of these properties will be added as part of the value for the\n    components's `class` attribute. These properties can be computed properties:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n    import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['propertyA', 'propertyB'],\n  \n      propertyA: 'from-a',\n      propertyB: computed(function() {\n        if (someLogic) { return 'from-b'; }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view from-a from-b\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    If the value of a class name binding returns a boolean the property name\n    itself will be used as the class name if the property is true. The class name\n    will not be added if the value is `false` or `undefined`.\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['hovered'],\n  \n      hovered: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view hovered\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Custom Class Names for Boolean Values\n  \n    When using boolean class name bindings you can supply a string value other\n    than the property name for use as the `class` HTML attribute by appending the\n    preferred value after a \":\" character when defining the binding:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['awesome:so-very-cool'],\n  \n      awesome: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view so-very-cool\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Boolean value class name bindings whose property names are in a\n    camelCase-style format will be converted to a dasherized format:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isUrgent'],\n  \n      isUrgent: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view is-urgent\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Class name bindings can also refer to object values that are found by\n    traversing a path relative to the component itself:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['messages.empty'],\n  \n      messages: EmberObject.create({\n        empty: true\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view empty\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    If you want to add a class name for a property which evaluates to true and\n    and a different class name if it evaluates to false, you can pass a binding\n    like this:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled'],\n      isEnabled: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view enabled\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    When isEnabled is `false`, the resulting HTML representation looks like this:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    This syntax offers the convenience to add a class if a property is `false`:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    // Applies no class when isEnabled is true and class 'disabled' when isEnabled is false\n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isEnabled::disabled'],\n      isEnabled: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component when the `isEnabled` property is true will produce\n    HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking it when the `isEnabled` property on the component is `false` will\n    produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Updates to the value of a class name binding will result in automatic update\n    of the  HTML `class` attribute in the component's rendered HTML\n    representation. If the value becomes `false` or `undefined` the class name\n    will be removed.\n  \n    Both `classNames` and `classNameBindings` are concatenated properties. See\n    [EmberObject](/api/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more\n    information about concatenated properties.\n  \n    ## HTML Attributes\n  \n    The HTML attribute section of a component's tag can be set by providing an\n    `attributeBindings` property set to an array of property names on the component.\n    The return value of these properties will be used as the value of the component's\n    HTML associated attribute:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-anchor.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'a',\n      attributeBindings: ['href'],\n  \n      href: 'http://google.com'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n    ```\n  \n    One property can be mapped on to another by placing a \":\" between\n    the source property and the destination property:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-anchor.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'a',\n      attributeBindings: ['url:href'],\n  \n      url: 'http://google.com'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n    ```\n  \n    Namespaced attributes (e.g. `xlink:href`) are supported, but have to be\n    mapped, since `:` is not a valid character for properties in Javascript:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-use.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'use',\n      attributeBindings: ['xlinkHref:xlink:href'],\n  \n      xlinkHref: '#triangle'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <use xlink:href=\"#triangle\"></use>\n    ```\n  \n    If the value of a property monitored by `attributeBindings` is a boolean, the\n    attribute will be present or absent depending on the value:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'input',\n      attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n  \n      disabled: false\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <input id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" />\n    ```\n  \n    `attributeBindings` can refer to computed properties:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n    import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'input',\n      attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n  \n      disabled: computed(function() {\n        if (someLogic) {\n          return true;\n        } else {\n          return false;\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    To prevent setting an attribute altogether, use `null` or `undefined` as the\n    value of the property used in `attributeBindings`:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'form',\n      attributeBindings: ['novalidate'],\n      novalidate: null\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Updates to the property of an attribute binding will result in automatic\n    update of the  HTML attribute in the component's HTML output.\n  \n    `attributeBindings` is a concatenated property. See\n    [EmberObject](/api/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more\n    information about concatenated properties.\n  \n    ## Layouts\n  \n    The `layout` property can be used to dynamically specify a template associated\n    with a component class, instead of relying on Ember to link together a\n    component class and a template based on file names.\n  \n    In general, applications should not use this feature, but it's commonly used\n    in addons for historical reasons.\n  \n    The `layout` property should be set to the default export of a template\n    module, which is the name of a template file without the `.hbs` extension.\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>Person's Title</h1>\n    <div class='details'>{{yield}}</div>\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n      import layout from '../templates/components/person-profile';\n  \n      export default Component.extend({\n        layout\n      });\n    ```\n  \n    If you invoke the component:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <PersonProfile>\n      <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n      <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n    </PersonProfile>\n    ```\n  \n    or\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#person-profile}}\n      <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n      <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n    {{/person-profile}}\n    ```\n  \n    It will result in the following HTML output:\n  \n    ```html\n    <h1>Person's Title</h1>\n      <div class=\"details\">\n      <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n      <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    ## Handling Browser Events\n  \n    Components can respond to user-initiated events in one of three ways: method\n    implementation, through an event manager, and through `{{action}}` helper use\n    in their template or layout.\n  \n    ### Method Implementation\n  \n    Components can respond to user-initiated events by implementing a method that\n    matches the event name. An event object will be passed as the argument to this\n    method.\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      click(event) {\n        // will be called with a browser event when an instance's rendered element\n        // is clicked\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ### `{{action}}` Helper\n  \n    See [Ember.Templates.helpers.action](/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/yield?anchor=yield).\n  \n    ### Event Names\n  \n    All of the event handling approaches described above respond to the same set\n    of events. The names of the built-in events are listed below. (The hash of\n    built-in events exists in `Ember.EventDispatcher`.) Additional, custom events\n    can be registered by using `Application.customEvents`.\n  \n    Touch events:\n  \n    * `touchStart`\n    * `touchMove`\n    * `touchEnd`\n    * `touchCancel`\n  \n    Keyboard events:\n  \n    * `keyDown`\n    * `keyUp`\n    * `keyPress`\n  \n    Mouse events:\n  \n    * `mouseDown`\n    * `mouseUp`\n    * `contextMenu`\n    * `click`\n    * `doubleClick`\n    * `mouseMove`\n    * `focusIn`\n    * `focusOut`\n    * `mouseEnter`\n    * `mouseLeave`\n  \n    Form events:\n  \n    * `submit`\n    * `change`\n    * `focusIn`\n    * `focusOut`\n    * `input`\n  \n    HTML5 drag and drop events:\n  \n    * `dragStart`\n    * `drag`\n    * `dragEnter`\n    * `dragLeave`\n    * `dragOver`\n    * `dragEnd`\n    * `drop`\n  \n    @class Component\n    @extends Ember.CoreView\n    @uses Ember.TargetActionSupport\n    @uses Ember.ClassNamesSupport\n    @uses Ember.ActionSupport\n    @uses Ember.ViewMixin\n    @uses Ember.ViewStateSupport\n    @public\n  */\n\n  var Component = _views.CoreView.extend(_views.ChildViewsSupport, _views.ViewStateSupport, _views.ClassNamesSupport, _runtime.TargetActionSupport, _views.ActionSupport, _views.ViewMixin, (_CoreView$extend = {\n    isComponent: true,\n    init: function () {\n      var _this11 = this;\n\n      this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n\n      this[IS_DISPATCHING_ATTRS] = false;\n      this[DIRTY_TAG] = _reference.DirtyableTag.create();\n      this[ROOT_REF] = new RootReference(this);\n      this[BOUNDS] = null; // If in a tagless component, assert that no event handlers are defined\n\n      false && !(this.tagName !== '' || !this.renderer._destinedForDOM || !function () {\n        var eventDispatcher = (0, _owner.getOwner)(_this11).lookup('event_dispatcher:main');\n        var events = eventDispatcher && eventDispatcher._finalEvents || {}; // tslint:disable-next-line:forin\n\n        for (var key in events) {\n          var methodName = events[key];\n\n          if (typeof _this11[methodName] === 'function') {\n            return true; // indicate that the assertion should be triggered\n          }\n        }\n\n        return false;\n      }()) && (0, _debug.assert)( // tslint:disable-next-line:max-line-length\n      \"You can not define a function that handles DOM events in the `\" + this + \"` tagless component since it doesn't have any DOM element.\", this.tagName !== '' || !this.renderer._destinedForDOM || !function () {\n        var eventDispatcher = (0, _owner.getOwner)(_this11).lookup('event_dispatcher:main');\n        var events = eventDispatcher && eventDispatcher._finalEvents || {};\n\n        for (var key in events) {\n          var methodName = events[key];\n\n          if (typeof _this11[methodName] === 'function') {\n            return true;\n          }\n        }\n\n        return false;\n      }());\n    },\n    rerender: function () {\n      this[DIRTY_TAG].inner.dirty();\n\n      this._super();\n    }\n  }, _CoreView$extend[_metal.PROPERTY_DID_CHANGE] = function (key) {\n    if (this[IS_DISPATCHING_ATTRS]) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    var args = this[ARGS];\n    var reference = args !== undefined ?

If the user types text into the textarea, the `@value`\n    argument is updated. If the `@value` argument is updated, the text in the textarea is updated.\n  \n    In the following example, the `writtenWords` property on the component will be updated as the user\n    types 'Lots of text' into the text area of their browser's window.\n  \n    ```app/components/word-editor.js\n    import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n    import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';\n  \n    export default class extends Component {\n      @tracked writtenWords = \"Lots of text that IS bound\";\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <Textarea @value={{writtenWords}} />\n    ```\n  \n    Would result in the following HTML:\n  \n    ```html\n    <textarea class=\"ember-text-area\">\n      Lots of text that IS bound\n    </textarea>\n    ```\n  \n    If you wanted a one way binding, you could use the `<textarea>` element directly, and use the\n    `value` DOM property and the `input` event.\n  \n    ### Actions\n  \n    The `Textarea` component takes a number of arguments with callbacks that are invoked in\n    response to user events.\n  \n    * `enter`\n    * `insert-newline`\n    * `escape-press`\n    * `focus-in`\n    * `focus-out`\n    * `key-press`\n  \n    These callbacks are passed to `Textarea` like this:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <Textarea @value={{this.searchWord}} @enter={{this.query}} />\n    ```\n  \n    ## Classic Invocation Syntax\n  \n    The `Textarea` component can also be invoked using curly braces, just like any other Ember\n    component.\n  \n    For example, this is an invocation using angle-bracket notation:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <Textarea @value={{this.searchWord}} @enter={{this.query}} />\n    ```\n  \n    You could accomplish the same thing using classic invocation:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{textarea value=this.searchWord enter=this.query}}\n    ```\n  \n    The main difference is that angle-bracket invocation supports any HTML attribute using HTML\n    attribute syntax, because attributes and arguments have different syntax when using angle-bracket\n    invocation. Curly brace invocation, on the other hand, only has a single syntax for arguments,\n    and components must manually map attributes onto component arguments.\n  \n    When using classic invocation with `{{textarea}}`, only the following attributes are mapped onto\n    arguments:\n  \n    * rows\n    * cols\n    * name\n    * selectionEnd\n    * selectionStart\n    * autocomplete\n    * wrap\n    * lang\n    * dir\n    * value\n  \n    ## Classic `layout` and `layoutName` properties\n  \n    Because HTML `textarea` elements do not contain inner HTML the `layout` and\n    `layoutName` properties will not be applied.\n  \n    @method Textarea\n    @for Ember.Templates.components\n    @see {TextArea}\n    @public\n  */\n\n  /**\n    See Ember.Templates.components.Textarea.\n  \n    @method textarea\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @see {Ember.Templates.components.textarea}\n    @public\n  */\n\n  /**\n    The internal representation used for `Textarea` invocations.\n  \n    @class TextArea\n    @extends Component\n    @see {Ember.Templates.components.Textarea}\n    @uses Ember.TextSupport\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  var TextArea = Component.extend(_views.TextSupport, {\n    classNames: ['ember-text-area'],\n    layout: layout,\n    tagName: 'textarea',\n    attributeBindings: ['rows', 'cols', 'name', 'selectionEnd', 'selectionStart', 'autocomplete', 'wrap', 'lang', 'dir', 'value'],\n    rows: null,\n    cols: null\n  });\n  _exports.TextArea = TextArea;\n\n  TextArea.toString = function () {\n    return '@ember/component/text-area';\n  };\n\n  var layout$1 = template({\n    \"id\": \"giTNx+op\",\n    \"block\": \"{\\\"symbols\\\":[\\\"&default\\\"],\\\"statements\\\":[[4,\\\"if\\\",[[25,1]],null,{\\\"statements\\\":[[14,1]],\\\"parameters\\\":[]},{\\\"statements\\\":[[1,[23,0,[\\\"linkTitle\\\"]],false]],\\\"parameters\\\":[]}]],\\\"hasEval\\\":false}\",\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"moduleName\": \"packages/@ember/-internals/glimmer/lib/templates/link-to.hbs\"\n    }\n  });\n  /**\n  @module ember\n  */\n\n  var LinkComponent;\n\n  if (true\n  /* EMBER_GLIMMER_ANGLE_BRACKET_BUILT_INS */\n  ) {\n      /**\n        The `LinkTo` component renders a link to the supplied `routeName` passing an optionally\n        supplied model to the route as its `model` context of the route. The block for `LinkTo`\n        becomes the contents of the rendered element:\n           ```handlebars\n        <LinkTo @route='photoGallery'>\n          Great Hamster Photos\n        </LinkTo>\n        ```\n           This will result in:\n           ```html\n        <a href=\"/hamster-photos\">\n          Great Hamster Photos\n        </a>\n        ```\n           ### Disabling the `LinkTo` component\n           The `LinkTo` component can be disabled by using the `disabled` argument. A disabled link\n        doesn't result in a transition when activated, and adds the `disabled` class to the `<a>`\n        element.\n           (The class name to apply to the element can be overridden by using the `disabledClass`\n        argument)\n           ```handlebars\n        <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @disabled={{true}}>\n          Great Hamster Photos\n        </LinkTo>\n        ```\n           ### Handling `href`\n           `<LinkTo>` will use your application's Router to fill the element's `href` property with a URL\n        that matches the path to the supplied `routeName`.\n           ### Handling current route\n           The `LinkTo` component will apply a CSS class name of 'active' when the application's current\n        route matches the supplied routeName. For example, if the application's current route is\n        'photoGallery.recent', then the following invocation of `LinkTo`:\n           ```handlebars\n        <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.recent'>\n          Great Hamster Photos\n        </LinkTo>\n        ```\n           will result in\n           ```html\n        <a href=\"/hamster-photos/this-week\" class=\"active\">\n          Great Hamster Photos\n        </a>\n        ```\n           The CSS class used for active classes can be customized by passing an `activeClass` argument:\n           ```handlebars\n        <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.recent' @activeClass=\"current-url\">\n          Great Hamster Photos\n        </LinkTo>\n        ```\n           ```html\n        <a href=\"/hamster-photos/this-week\" class=\"current-url\">\n          Great Hamster Photos\n        </a>\n        ```\n           ### Keeping a link active for other routes\n           If you need a link to be 'active' even when it doesn't match the current route, you can use the\n        `current-when` argument.\n           ```handlebars\n        <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @current-when='photos'>\n          Photo Gallery\n        </LinkTo>\n        ```\n           This may be helpful for keeping links active for:\n           * non-nested routes that are logically related\n        * some secondary menu approaches\n        * 'top navigation' with 'sub navigation' scenarios\n           A link will be active if `current-when` is `true` or the current\n        route is the route this link would transition to.\n           To match multiple routes 'space-separate' the routes:\n           ```handlebars\n        <LinkTo @route='gallery' @current-when='photos drawings paintings'>\n          Art Gallery\n        </LinkTo>\n        ```\n           ### Supplying a model\n           An optional `model` argument can be used for routes whose\n        paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become\n        the model context of the linked route:\n           ```javascript\n        Router.map(function() {\n          this.route(\"photoGallery\", {path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\"});\n        });\n        ```\n           ```handlebars\n        <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @model={{this.aPhoto}}>\n          {{aPhoto.title}}\n        </LinkTo>\n        ```\n           ```html\n        <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42\">\n          Tomster\n        </a>\n        ```\n           ### Supplying multiple models\n           For deep-linking to route paths that contain multiple\n        dynamic segments, the `models` argument can be used.\n           As the router transitions through the route path, each\n        supplied model argument will become the context for the\n        route with the dynamic segments:\n           ```javascript\n        Router.map(function() {\n          this.route(\"photoGallery\", { path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\" }, function() {\n            this.route(\"comment\", {path: \"comments/:comment_id\"});\n          });\n        });\n        ```\n           This argument will become the model context of the linked route:\n           ```handlebars\n        <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.comment' @models={{array this.aPhoto this.comment}}>\n          {{comment.body}}\n        </LinkTo>\n        ```\n           ```html\n        <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42/comments/718\">\n          A+++ would snuggle again.\n        </a>\n        ```\n           ### Supplying an explicit dynamic segment value\n           If you don't have a model object available to pass to `LinkTo`,\n        an optional string or integer argument can be passed for routes whose\n        paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become the value\n        of the dynamic segment:\n           ```javascript\n        Router.map(function() {\n          this.route(\"photoGallery\", { path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\" });\n        });\n        ```\n           ```handlebars\n        <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @model={{aPhotoId}}>\n          {{this.aPhoto.title}}\n        </LinkTo>\n        ```\n           ```html\n        <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42\">\n          Tomster\n        </a>\n        ```\n           When transitioning into the linked route, the `model` hook will\n        be triggered with parameters including this passed identifier.\n           ### Allowing Default Action\n           By default the `<LinkTo>` component prevents the default browser action by calling\n        `preventDefault()` to avoid reloading the browser page.\n           If you need to trigger a full browser reload pass `@preventDefault={{false}}`:\n           ```handlebars\n        <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @model={{this.aPhotoId}} @preventDefault={{false}}>\n          {{this.aPhotoId.title}}\n        </LinkTo>\n        ```\n           ### Supplying a `tagName`\n           By default `<LinkTo>` renders an `<a>` element. This can be overridden for a single use of\n        `<LinkTo>` by supplying a `tagName` argument:\n           ```handlebars\n        <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @tagName='li'>\n          Great Hamster Photos\n        </LinkTo>\n        ```\n           This produces:\n           ```html\n        <li>\n          Great Hamster Photos\n        </li>\n        ```\n           In general, this is not recommended. Instead, you can use the `transition-to` helper together\n        with a click event handler on the HTML tag of your choosing.\n           @for Ember.Templates.components\n        @method LinkTo\n        @see {LinkComponent}\n        @public\n      */\n\n      /**\n        @module @ember/routing\n      */\n\n      /**\n        See [Ember.Templates.components.LinkTo](/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.components/methods/input?anchor=input).\n           @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n        @method link-to\n        @see {Ember.Templates.components.LinkTo}\n        @public\n      **/\n\n      /**\n        `LinkComponent` is the internal component invoked with `<LinkTo>` or `{{link-to}}`.\n           @class LinkComponent\n        @extends Component\n        @see {Ember.Templates.components.LinkTo}\n        @public\n      **/\n      var UNDEFINED = Object.freeze({\n        toString: function () {\n          return 'UNDEFINED';\n        }\n      });\n      var EMPTY_QUERY_PARAMS = Object.freeze({});\n      LinkComponent = Component.extend({\n        layout: layout$1,\n        tagName: 'a',\n\n        /**\n          @property route\n          @category EMBER_GLIMMER_ANGLE_BRACKET_BUILT_INS\n          @public\n        */\n        route: UNDEFINED,\n\n        /**\n          @property model\n          @category EMBER_GLIMMER_ANGLE_BRACKET_BUILT_INS\n          @public\n        */\n        model: UNDEFINED,\n\n        /**\n          @property models\n          @category EMBER_GLIMMER_ANGLE_BRACKET_BUILT_INS\n          @public\n        */\n        models: UNDEFINED,\n\n        /**\n          @property query\n          @category EMBER_GLIMMER_ANGLE_BRACKET_BUILT_INS\n          @public\n        */\n        query: UNDEFINED,\n\n        /**\n          Used to determine when this `LinkComponent` is active.\n               @property current-when\n          @public\n        */\n        'current-when': null,\n\n        /**\n          Sets the `title` attribute of the `LinkComponent`'s HTML element.\n               @property title\n          @default null\n          @public\n        **/\n        title: null,\n\n        /**\n          Sets the `rel` attribute of the `LinkComponent`'s HTML element.\n               @property rel\n          @default null\n          @public\n        **/\n        rel: null,\n\n        /**\n          Sets the `tabindex` attribute of the `LinkComponent`'s HTML element.\n               @property tabindex\n          @default null\n          @public\n        **/\n        tabindex: null,\n\n        /**\n          Sets the `target` attribute of the `LinkComponent`'s HTML element.\n               @since 1.8.0\n          @property target\n          @default null\n          @public\n        **/\n        target: null,\n\n        /**\n          The CSS class to apply to `LinkComponent`'s element when its `active`\n          property is `true`.\n               @property activeClass\n          @type String\n          @default active\n          @public\n        **/\n        activeClass: 'active',\n\n        /**\n          The CSS class to apply to `LinkComponent`'s element when its `loading`\n          property is `true`.\n               @property loadingClass\n          @type String\n          @default loading\n          @private\n        **/\n        loadingClass: 'loading',\n\n        /**\n          The CSS class to apply to a `LinkComponent`'s element when its `disabled`\n          property is `true`.\n               @property disabledClass\n          @type String\n          @default disabled\n          @private\n        **/\n        disabledClass: 'disabled',\n\n        /**\n          Determines whether the `LinkComponent` will trigger routing via\n          the `replaceWith` routing strategy.\n               @property replace\n          @type Boolean\n          @default false\n          @public\n        **/\n        replace: false,\n\n        /**\n          By default this component will forward `href`, `title`, `rel`, `tabindex`, and `target`\n          arguments to attributes on the component's element.

The block\n      for `{{link-to}}` becomes the innerHTML of the rendered\n      element:\n         ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery'}}\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n         You can also use an inline form of `{{link-to}}` component by\n      passing the link text as the first argument\n      to the component:\n         ```handlebars\n      {{link-to 'Great Hamster Photos' 'photoGallery'}}\n      ```\n         Both will result in:\n         ```html\n      <a href=\"/hamster-photos\">\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      </a>\n      ```\n         ### Supplying a tagName\n      By default `{{link-to}}` renders an `<a>` element. This can\n      be overridden for a single use of `{{link-to}}` by supplying\n      a `tagName` option:\n         ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery' tagName=\"li\"}}\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n         ```html\n      <li>\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      </li>\n      ```\n         To override this option for your entire application, see\n      \"Overriding Application-wide Defaults\".\n         ### Disabling the `link-to` component\n      By default `{{link-to}}` is enabled.\n      any passed value to the `disabled` component property will disable\n      the `link-to` component.\n         static use: the `disabled` option:\n         ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery' disabled=true}}\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n         dynamic use: the `disabledWhen` option:\n         ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery' disabledWhen=controller.someProperty}}\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n         any truthy value passed to `disabled` will disable it except `undefined`.\n         See \"Overriding Application-wide Defaults\" for more.\n         ### Handling `href`\n      `{{link-to}}` will use your application's Router to\n      fill the element's `href` property with a url that\n      matches the path to the supplied `routeName` for your\n      router's configured `Location` scheme, which defaults\n      to HashLocation.\n         ### Handling current route\n      `{{link-to}}` will apply a CSS class name of 'active'\n      when the application's current route matches\n      the supplied routeName. For example, if the application's\n      current route is 'photoGallery.recent' the following\n      use of `{{link-to}}`:\n         ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery.recent'}}\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n         will result in\n         ```html\n      <a href=\"/hamster-photos/this-week\" class=\"active\">\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      </a>\n      ```\n         The CSS class name used for active classes can be customized\n      for a single use of `{{link-to}}` by passing an `activeClass`\n      option:\n         ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery.recent' activeClass=\"current-url\"}}\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n         ```html\n      <a href=\"/hamster-photos/this-week\" class=\"current-url\">\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      </a>\n      ```\n         To override this option for your entire application, see\n      \"Overriding Application-wide Defaults\".\n         ### Keeping a link active for other routes\n         If you need a link to be 'active' even when it doesn't match\n      the current route, you can use the `current-when` argument.\n         ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery' current-when='photos'}}\n        Photo Gallery\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n         This may be helpful for keeping links active for:\n         * non-nested routes that are logically related\n      * some secondary menu approaches\n      * 'top navigation' with 'sub navigation' scenarios\n         A link will be active if `current-when` is `true` or the current\n      route is the route this link would transition to.\n         To match multiple routes 'space-separate' the routes:\n         ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'gallery' current-when='photos drawings paintings'}}\n        Art Gallery\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n         ### Supplying a model\n      An optional model argument can be used for routes whose\n      paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become\n      the model context of the linked route:\n         ```javascript\n      Router.map(function() {\n        this.route(\"photoGallery\", {path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\"});\n      });\n      ```\n         ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhoto}}\n        {{aPhoto.title}}\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n         ```html\n      <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42\">\n        Tomster\n      </a>\n      ```\n         ### Supplying multiple models\n      For deep-linking to route paths that contain multiple\n      dynamic segments, multiple model arguments can be used.\n      As the router transitions through the route path, each\n      supplied model argument will become the context for the\n      route with the dynamic segments:\n         ```javascript\n      Router.map(function() {\n        this.route(\"photoGallery\", { path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\" }, function() {\n          this.route(\"comment\", {path: \"comments/:comment_id\"});\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n      This argument will become the model context of the linked route:\n         ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery.comment' aPhoto comment}}\n        {{comment.body}}\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n         ```html\n      <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42/comments/718\">\n        A+++ would snuggle again.\n      </a>\n      ```\n         ### Supplying an explicit dynamic segment value\n      If you don't have a model object available to pass to `{{link-to}}`,\n      an optional string or integer argument can be passed for routes whose\n      paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become the value\n      of the dynamic segment:\n         ```javascript\n      Router.map(function() {\n        this.route(\"photoGallery\", { path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\" });\n      });\n      ```\n         ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhotoId}}\n        {{aPhoto.title}}\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n         ```html\n      <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42\">\n        Tomster\n      </a>\n      ```\n         When transitioning into the linked route, the `model` hook will\n      be triggered with parameters including this passed identifier.\n         ### Allowing Default Action\n         By default the `{{link-to}}` component prevents the default browser action\n      by calling `preventDefault()` as this sort of action bubbling is normally\n      handled internally and we do not want to take the browser to a new URL (for\n      example).\n         If you need to override this behavior specify `preventDefault=false` in\n      your template:\n         ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhotoId preventDefault=false}}\n        {{aPhotoId.title}}\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n         ### Overriding attributes\n      You can override any given property of the `LinkComponent`\n      that is generated by the `{{link-to}}` component by passing\n      key/value pairs, like so:\n         ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to  aPhoto tagName='li' title='Following this link will change your life' classNames='pic sweet'}}\n        Uh-mazing!\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n         See [LinkComponent](/api/ember/release/classes/LinkComponent) for a\n      complete list of overrideable properties. Be sure to also\n      check out inherited properties of `LinkComponent`.\n         ### Overriding Application-wide Defaults\n         ``{{link-to}}`` creates an instance of `LinkComponent` for rendering. To\n      override options for your entire application, export your customized\n      `LinkComponent` from `app/components/link-to.js` with the desired overrides:\n         ```javascript\n      // app/components/link-to.js\n      import LinkComponent from '@ember/routing/link-component';\n         export default LinkComponent.extend({\n        activeClass: \"is-active\",\n        tagName: 'li'\n      })\n      ```\n         It is also possible to override the default event in this manner:\n         ```javascript\n      import LinkComponent from '@ember/routing/link-component';\n         export default LinkComponent.extend({\n        eventName: 'customEventName'\n      });\n      ```\n         @method link-to\n      @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n      @param {String} routeName\n      @param {Object} [context]*\n      @param [options] {Object} Handlebars key/value pairs of options, you can override any property of Ember.LinkComponent\n      @return {String} HTML string\n      @see {LinkComponent}\n      @public\n    */\n\n    /**\n      @module @ember/routing\n    */\n\n    /**\n      `LinkComponent` renders an element whose `click` event triggers a\n      transition of the application's instance of `Router` to\n      a supplied route by name.\n         `LinkComponent` components are invoked with {{#link-to}}.

It is an extension\n    of the base Handlebars `{{#each}}` helper.\n    The default behavior of `{{#each}}` is to yield its inner block once for every\n    item in an array passing the item as the first block parameter.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    var developers = [{ name: 'Yehuda' },{ name: 'Tom' }, { name: 'Paul' }];\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each developers key=\"name\" as |person|}}\n      {{person.name}}\n      {{! `this` is whatever it was outside the #each }}\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n  \n    The same rules apply to arrays of primitives.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    var developerNames = ['Yehuda', 'Tom', 'Paul']\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each developerNames key=\"@index\" as |name|}}\n      {{name}}\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n  \n    During iteration, the index of each item in the array is provided as a second block parameter.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <ul>\n      {{#each people as |person index|}}\n        <li>Hello, {{person.name}}! You're number {{index}} in line</li>\n      {{/each}}\n    </ul>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Specifying Keys\n  \n    The `key` option is used to tell Ember how to determine if the array being\n    iterated over with `{{#each}}` has changed between renders. By helping Ember\n    detect that some elements in the array are the same, DOM elements can be\n    re-used, significantly improving rendering speed.\n  \n    For example, here's the `{{#each}}` helper with its `key` set to `id`:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each model key=\"id\" as |item|}}\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n  \n    When this `{{#each}}` re-renders, Ember will match up the previously rendered\n    items (and reorder the generated DOM elements) based on each item's `id`\n    property.\n    By default the item's own reference is used.\n  \n    ### {{else}} condition\n  \n    `{{#each}}` can have a matching `{{else}}`. The contents of this block will render\n    if the collection is empty.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each developers as |person|}}\n      {{person.name}}\n    {{else}}\n      <p>Sorry, nobody is available for this task.</p>\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n  \n    @method each\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @public\n   */\n\n  /**\n    The `{{each-in}}` helper loops over properties on an

{Hash} options\n        @public\n       */\n\n      /**\n        The `Input` component lets you create an HTML `<input>` element.\n           ```handlebars\n        <Input @value=\"987\" />\n        ```\n           creates an `<input>` element with `type=\"text\"` and value set to 987.\n           ### Text field\n           If no `type` argument is specified, a default of type 'text' is used.\n           ```handlebars\n        Search:\n        <Input @value={{this.searchWord}}>\n        ```\n           In this example, the initial value in the `<input>` will be set to the value of\n        `this.searchWord`. If the user changes the text, the value of `this.searchWord` will also be\n        updated.\n           ### Actions\n           The `Input` component takes a number of arguments with callbacks that are invoked in response to\n        user events.\n           * `enter`\n        * `insert-newline`\n        * `escape-press`\n        * `focus-in`\n        * `focus-out`\n        * `key-press`\n        * `key-up`\n           These callbacks are passed to `Input` like this:\n           ```handlebars\n        <Input @value={{this.searchWord}} @enter={{this.query}} />\n        ```\n           ### `<input>` HTML Attributes to Avoid\n           In most cases, if you want to pass an attribute to the underlying HTML `<input>` element, you\n        can pass the attribute directly, just like any other Ember component.\n           ```handlebars\n        <Input @type=\"text\" size=\"10\" />\n        ```\n           In this example, the `size` attribute will be applied to the underlying `<input>` element in the\n        outputted HTML.\n           However, there are a few attributes where you **must** use the `@` version.\n           * `@type`: This argument is used to control which Ember component is used under the hood\n        * `@value`: The `@value` argument installs a two-way binding onto the element. If you wanted a\n          one-way binding, use `<input>` with the `value` property and the `input` event instead.\n        * `@checked` (for checkboxes): like `@value`, the `@checked` argument installs a two-way binding\n          onto the element. If you wanted a one-way binding, use `<input type=\"checkbox\">` with\n          `checked` and the `input` event instead.\n           ### Extending `TextField`\n           Internally, `<Input @type=\"text\" />` creates an instance of `TextField`, passing arguments from\n        the helper to `TextField`'s `create` method. Subclassing `TextField` is supported but not\n        recommended.\n           See [TextField](/api/ember/release/classes/TextField)\n           ### Checkbox\n           To create an `<input type=\"checkbox\">`:\n           ```handlebars\n        Emberize Everything:\n        <Input @type=\"checkbox\" @checked={{this.isEmberized}} name=\"isEmberized\" />\n        ```\n           This will bind the checked state of this checkbox to the value of `isEmberized` -- if either one\n        changes, it will be reflected in the other.\n           ### Extending `Checkbox`\n           Internally, `<Input @type=\"checkbox\" />` creates an instance of `Checkbox`. Subclassing\n        `TextField` is supported but not recommended.\n           See [Checkbox](/api/ember/release/classes/Checkbox)\n           @method Input\n        @for Ember.Templates.components\n        @see {TextField}\n        @see {Checkbox}\n        @param {Hash} options\n        @public\n      */\n      Input = _runtime.Object.extend({\n        isCheckbox: (0, _metal.computed)('type', function () {\n          return this.type === 'checkbox';\n        })\n      });\n      setManager({\n        factory: InputComponentManagerFactory,\n        internal: true,\n        type: 'component'\n      }, Input);\n\n      Input.toString = function () {\n        return '@ember/component/input';\n      };\n    }\n\n  var Input$1 = Input; ///<reference path=\"./simple-dom.d.ts\" />\n\n  /**\n  @module ember\n  */\n\n  /**\n    Calls [loc](/api/classes/Ember.String.html#method_loc) with the\n    provided string.

just a function) between components, and into components from controllers.\n  \n    ### Passing functions with the action helper\n  \n    There are three contexts an action helper can be used in. The first two\n    contexts to discuss are attribute context, and Handlebars value context.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{! An example of attribute context }}\n    <div onclick={{action \"save\"}}></div>\n    {{! Examples of Handlebars value context }}\n    {{input on-input=(action \"save\")}}\n    {{yield (action \"refreshData\") andAnotherParam}}\n    ```\n  \n    In these contexts,\n    the helper is called a \"closure action\" helper. Its behavior is simple:\n    If passed a function name, read that function off the `actions` property\n    of the current context. Once that function is read, or immediately if a function was\n    passed, create a closure over that function and any arguments.\n    The resulting value of an action helper used this way is simply a function.\n  \n    For example, in the attribute context:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{! An example of attribute context }}\n    <div onclick={{action \"save\"}}></div>\n    ```\n  \n    The resulting template render logic would be:\n  \n    ```js\n    var div = document.createElement('div');\n    var actionFunction = (function(context){\n      return function() {\n        return context.actions.save.apply(context, arguments);\n      };\n    })(context);\n    div.onclick = actionFunction;\n    ```\n  \n    Thus when the div is clicked, the action on that context is called.\n    Because the `actionFunction` is just a function, closure actions can be\n    passed between components and still execute in the correct context.\n  \n    Here is an example action handler on a component:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-component.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      actions: {\n        save() {\n          this.get('model').save();\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Actions are always looked up on the `actions` property of the current context.\n    This avoids collisions in the naming of common actions, such as `destroy`.\n    Two options can be passed to the `action` helper when it is used in this way.\n  \n    * `target=someProperty` will look to `someProperty` instead of the current\n      context for the `actions` hash. This can be useful when targeting a\n      service for actions.\n    * `value=\"target.value\"` will read the path `target.value` off the first\n      argument to the action when it is called and rewrite the first argument\n      to be that value. This is useful when attaching actions to event listeners.\n  \n    ### Invoking an action\n  \n    Closure actions curry both their scope and any arguments. When invoked, any\n    additional arguments are added to the already curried list.\n    Actions should be invoked using the [sendAction](/api/ember/release/classes/Component/methods/sendAction?anchor=sendAction)\n    method. The first argument to `sendAction` is the action to be called, and\n    additional arguments are passed to the action function. This has interesting\n    properties combined with currying of arguments. For example:\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/my-component.hbs\n    {{input on-input=(action (action 'setName' model) value=\"target.value\")}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/my-component.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      actions: {\n        setName(model, name) {\n          model.set('name', name);\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    The first argument (`model`) was curried over, and the run-time argument (`event`)\n    becomes a second argument. Action calls can be nested this way because each simply\n    returns a function. Any function can be passed to the `{{action}}` helper, including\n    other actions.\n  \n    Actions invoked with `sendAction` have the same currying behavior as demonstrated\n    with `on-input` above. For example:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-input.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      actions: {\n        setName(model, name) {\n          model.set('name', name);\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <MyInput @submit={{action 'setName' this.model}} />\n    ```\n    or\n    ```handlebars\n    {{my-input submit=(action 'setName' model)}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/my-component.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      click() {\n        // Note that model is not passed, it was curried in the template\n        this.sendAction('submit', 'bob');\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ### Attaching actions to DOM elements\n  \n    The third context of the `{{action}}` helper can be called \"element space\".\n    For example:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{! An example of element space }}\n    <div {{action \"save\"}}></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Used this way, the `{{action}}` helper provides a useful shortcut for\n    registering an HTML element in a template for a single DOM event and\n    forwarding that interaction to the template's context (controller or component).\n    If the context of a template is a controller, actions used this way will\n    bubble to routes when the controller does not implement the specified action.\n    Once an action hits a route, it will bubble through the route hierarchy.\n  \n    ### Event Propagation\n  \n    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can control event bubbling. Note\n    that the closure style actions cannot.\n  \n    Events triggered through the action helper will automatically have\n    `.preventDefault()` called on them. You do not need to do so in your event\n    handlers. If you need to allow event propagation (to handle file inputs for\n    example) you can supply the `preventDefault=false` option to the `{{action}}` helper:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"sayHello\" preventDefault=false}}>\n      <input type=\"file\" />\n      <input type=\"checkbox\" />\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    To disable bubbling, pass `bubbles=false` to the helper:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <button {{action 'edit' post bubbles=false}}>Edit</button>\n    ```\n  \n    To disable bubbling with closure style actions you must create your own\n    wrapper helper that makes use of `event.stopPropagation()`:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div onclick={{disable-bubbling (action \"sayHello\")}}>Hello</div>\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/helpers/disable-bubbling.js\n    import { helper } from '@ember/component/helper';\n  \n    export function disableBubbling([action]) {\n      return function(event) {\n        event.stopPropagation();\n        return action(event);\n      };\n    }\n    export default helper(disableBubbling);\n    ```\n  \n    If you need the default handler to trigger you should either register your\n    own event handler, or use event methods on your view class. See\n    [\"Responding to Browser Events\"](/api/ember/release/classes/Component)\n    in the documentation for `Component` for more information.\n  \n    ### Specifying DOM event type\n  \n    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify an event type.\n    By default the `{{action}}` helper registers for DOM `click` events. You can\n    supply an `on` option to the helper to specify a different DOM event name:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" on=\"doubleClick\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    See [\"Event Names\"](/api/ember/release/classes/Component) for a list of\n    acceptable DOM event names.\n  \n    ### Specifying whitelisted modifier keys\n  \n    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify modifier keys.\n    By default the `{{action}}` helper will ignore click events with pressed modifier\n    keys. You can supply an `allowedKeys` option to specify which keys should not be ignored.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"alt\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    This way the action will fire when clicking with the alt key pressed down.\n    Alternatively, supply \"any\" to the `allowedKeys` option to accept any combination of modifier keys.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"any\"}}>\n      click me with any key pressed\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Specifying a Target\n  \n    A `target` option can be provided to the helper to change\n    which object will receive the method call. This option must be a path\n    to an object, accessible in the current context:\n  \n    ```app/templates/application.hbs\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" target=someService}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/controllers/application.js\n    import Controller from '@ember/controller';\n    import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';\n  \n    export default Controller.extend({\n      someService: service()\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method action\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  function action(_vm, args) {\n    var named = args.named,\n        positional = args.positional;\n    var capturedArgs = positional.capture(); // The first two argument slots are reserved.\n    // pos[0] is the context (or `this`)\n    // pos[1] is the action name or function\n    // Anything else is an action argument.\n\n    var _capturedArgs$referen = capturedArgs.references,\n        context = _capturedArgs$referen[0],\n        action = _capturedArgs$referen[1],\n        restArgs = _capturedArgs$referen.slice(2); // TODO: Is there a better way of doing this?\n\n\n    var debugKey = action.propertyKey;\n    var target = named.has('target') ? named.get('target') : context;\n    var processArgs = makeArgsProcessor(named.has('value') && named.get('value'), restArgs);\n    var fn;\n\n    if (typeof action[INVOKE] === 'function') {\n      fn = makeClosureAction(action, action, action[INVOKE], processArgs, debugKey);\n    } else if ((0, _reference.isConst)(target) && (0, _reference.isConst)(action)) {\n      fn = makeClosureAction(context.value(), target.value(), action.value(), processArgs, debugKey);\n    } else {\n      fn = makeDynamicClosureAction(context.value(), target, action, processArgs, debugKey);\n    }\n\n    fn[ACTION] = true;\n    return new UnboundReference(fn);\n  }\n\n  function NOOP$1(args) {\n    return args;\n  }\n\n  function makeArgsProcessor(valuePathRef, actionArgsRef) {\n    var mergeArgs;\n\n    if (actionArgsRef.length > 0) {\n      mergeArgs = function (args) {\n        return actionArgsRef.map(function (ref) {\n          return ref.value();\n        }).concat(args);\n      };\n    }\n\n    var readValue;\n\n    if (valuePathRef) {\n      readValue = function (args) {\n        var valuePath = valuePathRef.value();\n\n        if (valuePath && args.length > 0) {\n          args[0] = (0, _metal.get)(args[0], valuePath);\n        }\n\n        return args;\n      };\n    }\n\n    if (mergeArgs && readValue) {\n      return function (args) {\n        return readValue(mergeArgs(args));\n      };\n    } else {\n      return mergeArgs || readValue || NOOP$1;\n    }\n  }\n\n  function makeDynamicClosureAction(context, targetRef, actionRef, processArgs, debugKey) {\n    // We don't allow undefined/null values, so this creates a throw-away action to trigger the assertions\n    if (false\n    /* DEBUG */\n    ) {\n        makeClosureAction(context, targetRef.value(), actionRef.value(), processArgs, debugKey);\n      }\n\n    return function () {\n      return makeClosureAction(context, targetRef.value(), actionRef.value(), processArgs, debugKey).apply(void 0, arguments);\n    };\n  }\n\n  function makeClosureAction(context, target, action, processArgs, debugKey) {\n    var self;\n    var fn;\n    false && !(action !== undefined && action !== null) && (0, _debug.assert)(\"Action passed is null or undefined in (action) from \" + target + \".\", action !== undefined && action !== null);\n\n    if (typeof action[INVOKE] === 'function') {\n      self = action;\n      fn = action[INVOKE];\n    } else {\n      var typeofAction = typeof action;\n\n      if (typeofAction === 'string') {\n        self = target;\n        fn = target.actions && target.actions[action];\n        false && !fn && (0, _debug.assert)(\"An action named '\" + action + \"' was not found in \" + target, fn);\n      } else if (typeofAction === 'function') {\n        self = context;\n        fn = action;\n      } else {\n        // tslint:disable-next-line:max-line-length\n        false && !false && (0, _debug.assert)(\"An action could not be made for `\" + (debugKey || action) + \"` in \" + target + \".

For more info,\n      see the [TextField](/api/ember/release/classes/TextField) docs and\n      the [templates guide](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/templates/input-helpers/).\n         ```handlebars\n      {{input value=\"987\"}}\n      ```\n         renders as:\n         ```HTML\n      <input type=\"text\" value=\"987\" />\n      ```\n         ### Text field\n         If no `type` option is specified, a default of type 'text' is used.\n      Many of the standard HTML attributes may be passed to this helper.\n      <table>\n        <tr><td>`readonly`</td><td>`required`</td><td>`autofocus`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`value`</td><td>`placeholder`</td><td>`disabled`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`size`</td><td>`tabindex`</td><td>`maxlength`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`name`</td><td>`min`</td><td>`max`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`pattern`</td><td>`accept`</td><td>`autocomplete`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`autosave`</td><td>`formaction`</td><td>`formenctype`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`formmethod`</td><td>`formnovalidate`</td><td>`formtarget`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`height`</td><td>`inputmode`</td><td>`multiple`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`step`</td><td>`width`</td><td>`form`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`selectionDirection`</td><td>`spellcheck`</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n      </table>\n      When set to a quoted string, these values will be directly applied to the HTML\n      element. When left unquoted, these values will be bound to a property on the\n      template's current rendering context (most typically a controller instance).\n      A very common use of this helper is to bind the `value` of an input to an Object's attribute:\n         ```handlebars\n      Search:\n      {{input value=searchWord}}\n      ```\n         In this example, the initial value in the `<input />` will be set to the value of `searchWord`.\n      If the user changes the text, the value of `searchWord` will also be updated.\n         ### Actions\n         The helper can send multiple actions based on user events.\n      The action property defines the action which is sent when\n      the user presses the return key.\n         ```handlebars\n      {{input action=\"submit\"}}\n      ```\n         The helper allows some user events to send actions.\n         * `enter`\n      * `insert-newline`\n      * `escape-press`\n      * `focus-in`\n      * `focus-out`\n      * `key-press`\n      * `key-up`\n         For example, if you desire an action to be sent when the input is blurred,\n      you only need to setup the action name to the event name property.\n         ```handlebars\n      {{input focus-out=\"alertMessage\"}}\n      ```\n      See more about [Text Support Actions](/api/ember/release/classes/TextField)\n         ### Extending `TextField`\n         Internally, `{{input type=\"text\"}}` creates an instance of `TextField`, passing\n      arguments from the helper to `TextField`'s `create` method. You can extend the\n      capabilities of text inputs in your applications by reopening this class. For example,\n      if you are building a Bootstrap project where `data-*` attributes are used, you\n      can add one to the `TextField`'s `attributeBindings` property:\n         ```javascript\n      import TextField from '@ember/component/text-field';\n      TextField.reopen({\n        attributeBindings: ['data-error']\n      });\n      ```\n         Keep in mind when writing `TextField` subclasses that `TextField`\n      itself extends `Component`. Expect isolated component semantics, not\n      legacy 1.x view semantics (like `controller` being present).\n      See more about [Ember components](/api/ember/release/classes/Component)\n         ### Checkbox\n         Checkboxes are special forms of the `{{input}}` helper.  To create a `<checkbox />`:\n         ```handlebars\n      Emberize Everything:\n      {{input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"isEmberized\" checked=isEmberized}}\n      ```\n         This will bind checked state of this checkbox to the value of `isEmberized`  -- if either one changes,\n      it will be reflected in the other.\n         The following HTML attributes can be set via the helper:\n         * `checked`\n      * `disabled`\n      * `tabindex`\n      * `indeterminate`\n      * `name`\n      * `autofocus`\n      * `form`\n         ### Extending `Checkbox`\n         Internally, `{{input type=\"checkbox\"}}` creates an instance of `Checkbox`, passing\n      arguments from the helper to `Checkbox`'s `create` method. You can extend the\n      capablilties of checkbox inputs in your applications by reopening this class. For example,\n      if you wanted to add a css class to all checkboxes in your application:\n         ```javascript\n      import Checkbox from '@ember/component/checkbox';\n         Checkbox.reopen({\n        classNames: ['my-app-checkbox']\n      });\n      ```\n         @method input\n      @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n      @param {Hash} options\n      @public\n    */\n

For example, given a component with the property \"name\",\n    that component's template can use the name in several ways:\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      name: 'Jill'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    {{name}}\n    <div>{{name}}</div>\n    <span data-name={{name}}></span>\n    ```\n  \n    Any time the \"name\" property on the component changes, the DOM will be\n    updated.\n  \n    Properties can be chained as well:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{aUserModel.name}}\n    <div>{{listOfUsers.firstObject.name}}</div>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Using Ember helpers\n  \n    When content is passed in mustaches `{{}}`, Ember will first try to find a helper\n    or component with that name. For example, the `if` helper:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{if name \"I have a name\" \"I have no name\"}}\n    <span data-has-name={{if name true}}></span>\n    ```\n  \n    The returned value is placed where the `{{}}` is called. The above style is\n    called \"inline\". A second style of helper usage is called \"block\". For example:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#if name}}\n    I have a name\n    {{else}}\n    I have no name\n    {{/if}}\n    ```\n  \n    The block form of helpers allows you to control how the UI is created based\n    on the values of properties.\n    A third form of helper is called \"nested\".

This is often more efficient than\n    creating new descriptor hashes for each property.\n  \n    ## Examples\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { defineProperty, computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    // ES5 compatible mode\n    defineProperty(contact, 'firstName', {\n      writable: true,\n      configurable: false,\n      enumerable: true,\n      value: 'Charles'\n    });\n  \n    // define a simple property\n    defineProperty(contact, 'lastName', undefined, 'Jolley');\n  \n    // define a computed property\n    defineProperty(contact, 'fullName', computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {\n      return this.firstName+' '+this.lastName;\n    }));\n    ```\n  \n    @public\n    @method defineProperty\n    @static\n    @for @ember/object\n    @param {Object} obj the object to define this property on.

By default the getter\n    will only be called once and the result will be cached. You can specify\n    various properties that your computed property depends on. This will force the\n    cached result to be cleared if the dependencies are modified, and lazily recomputed the next time something asks for it.\n  \n    In the following example we decorate a getter - `fullName` -  by calling\n    `computed` with the property dependencies (`firstName` and `lastName`) as\n    arguments. The `fullName` getter will be called once (regardless of how many\n    times it is accessed) as long as its dependencies do not change. Once\n    `firstName` or `lastName` are updated any future calls to `fullName` will\n    incorporate the new values, and any watchers of the value such as templates\n    will be updated:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    class Person {\n      constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n        set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n        set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n      }\n  \n      @computed('firstName', 'lastName')\n      get fullName() {\n        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n      }\n    });\n  \n    let tom = new Person('Tom', 'Dale');\n  \n    tom.fullName; // 'Tom Dale'\n    ```\n  \n    You can also provide a setter, which will be used when updating the computed\n    property. Ember's `set` function must be used to update the property\n    since it will also notify observers of the property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    class Person {\n      constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n        set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n        set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n      }\n  \n      @computed('firstName', 'lastName')\n      get fullName() {\n        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n      }\n  \n      set fullName(value) {\n        let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');\n  \n        set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n        set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n      }\n    });\n  \n    let person = new Person();\n  \n    set(person, 'fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');\n    person.firstName; // 'Peter'\n    person.lastName;  // 'Wagenet'\n    ```\n  \n    You can also pass a getter function or object with `get` and `set` functions\n    as the last argument to the computed decorator. This allows you to define\n    computed property _macros_:\n  \n    ```js\n    import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    function join(...keys) {\n      return computed(...keys, function() {\n        return keys.map(key => this[key]).join(' ');\n      });\n    }\n  \n    class Person {\n      @join('firstName', 'lastName')\n      fullName;\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Note that when defined this way, getters and setters receive the _key_ of the\n    property they are decorating as the first argument. Setters receive the value\n    they are setting to as the second argument instead. Additionally, setters must\n    _return_ the value that should be cached:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    function fullNameMacro(firstNameKey, lastNameKey) {\n      @computed(firstNameKey, lastNameKey, {\n        get() {\n          return `${this[firstNameKey]} ${this[lastNameKey]}`;\n        }\n  \n        set(key, value) {\n          let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');\n  \n          set(this, firstNameKey, firstName);\n          set(this, lastNameKey, lastName);\n  \n          return value;\n        }\n      });\n    }\n  \n    class Person {\n      constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n        set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n        set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n      }\n  \n      @fullNameMacro fullName;\n    });\n  \n    let person = new Person();\n  \n    set(person, 'fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');\n    person.firstName; // 'Peter'\n    person.lastName;  // 'Wagenet'\n    ```\n  \n    Computed properties can also be used in classic classes. To do this, we\n    provide the getter and setter as the last argument like we would for a macro,\n    and we assign it to a property on the class definition. This is an _anonymous_\n    computed macro:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import EmberObject, { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    let Person = EmberObject.extend({\n      // these will be supplied by `create`\n      firstName: null,\n      lastName: null,\n  \n      fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', {\n        get() {\n          return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n        }\n  \n        set(key, value) {\n          let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');\n  \n          set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n          set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n  \n          return value;\n        }\n      })\n    });\n  \n    let tom = Person.create({\n      firstName: 'Tom',\n      lastName: 'Dale'\n    });\n  \n    tom.get('fullName') // 'Tom Dale'\n    ```\n  \n    You can overwrite computed property without setters with a normal property (no\n    longer computed) that won't change if dependencies change. You can also mark\n    computed property as `.readOnly()` and block all attempts to set it.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    class Person {\n      constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n        set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n        set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n      }\n  \n      @computed('firstName', 'lastName').readOnly()\n      get fullName() {\n        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n      }\n    });\n  \n    let person = new Person();\n    person.set('fullName', 'Peter Wagenet'); // Uncaught Error: Cannot set read-only property \"fullName\" on object: <(...):emberXXX>\n    ```\n  \n    Additional resources:\n    - [Decorators RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0408-decorators.md)\n    - [New CP syntax RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0011-improved-cp-syntax.md)\n    - [New computed syntax explained in \"Ember 1.12 released\" ](https://emberjs.com/blog/2015/05/13/ember-1-12-released.html#toc_new-computed-syntax)\n  \n    @class ComputedProperty\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  var ComputedProperty =\n  /*#__PURE__*/\n  function (_ComputedDescriptor) {\n    (0, _emberBabel.inheritsLoose)(ComputedProperty, _ComputedDescriptor);\n\n    function ComputedProperty(args) {\n      var _this;\n\n      _this = _ComputedDescriptor.call(this) || this;\n      _this._volatile = false;\n      _this._readOnly = false;\n      _this._suspended = undefined;\n      _this._hasConfig = false;\n      _this._getter = undefined;\n      _this._setter = undefined;\n      var maybeConfig = args[args.length - 1];\n\n      if (typeof maybeConfig === 'function' || maybeConfig !== null && typeof maybeConfig === 'object') {\n        _this._hasConfig = true;\n        var config = args.pop();\n\n        if (typeof config === 'function') {\n          false && !!isClassicDecorator(config) && (0, _debug.assert)(\"You attempted to pass a computed property instance to computed().

This is handy for preventing extremely long route names.\n          Keep in mind that the actual URL path behavior is still retained.\n         The third parameter is a function, which can be used to nest routes.\n      Nested routes, by default, will have the parent route tree's route name and\n      path prepended to it's own.\n         ```app/router.js\n      Router.map(function(){\n        this.route('post', { path: '/post/:post_id' }, function() {\n          this.route('edit');\n          this.route('comments', { resetNamespace: true }, function() {\n            this.route('new');\n          });\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n         @method map\n      @param callback\n      @public\n    */\n    map: function (callback) {\n      if (!this.dslCallbacks) {\n        this.dslCallbacks = [];\n        this.reopenClass({\n          dslCallbacks: this.dslCallbacks\n        });\n      }\n\n      this.dslCallbacks.push(callback);\n      return this;\n    },\n    _routePath: function (routeInfos) {\n      var path = []; // We have to handle coalescing resource names that\n      // are prefixed with their parent's names, e.g.\n      // ['foo', 'foo.bar.baz'] => 'foo.bar.baz', not 'foo.foo.bar.baz'\n\n      function intersectionMatches(a1, a2) {\n        for (var i = 0; i < a1.length; ++i) {\n          if (a1[i] !== a2[i]) {\n            return false;\n          }\n        }\n\n        return true;\n      }\n\n      var name, nameParts, oldNameParts;\n\n      for (var i = 1; i < routeInfos.length; i++) {\n        name = routeInfos[i].name;\n        nameParts = name.split('.');\n        oldNameParts = slice.call(path);\n\n        while (oldNameParts.length) {\n          if (intersectionMatches(oldNameParts, nameParts)) {\n            break;\n          }\n\n          oldNameParts.shift();\n        }\n\n        path.push.apply(path, nameParts.slice(oldNameParts.length));\n      }\n\n      return path.join('.');\n    }\n  });\n\n  function didBeginTransition(transition, router) {\n    var routerState = new _router_state.default(router, router._routerMicrolib, transition[_router_js.STATE_SYMBOL]);\n\n    if (!router.currentState) {\n      router.set('currentState', routerState);\n    }\n\n    router.set('targetState', routerState);\n    transition.promise = transition.catch(function (error) {\n      if (router._isErrorHandled(error)) {\n        router._clearHandledError(error);\n      } else {\n        throw error;\n      }\n    }, 'Transition Error');\n  }\n\n  function forEachQueryParam(router, routeInfos, queryParams, callback) {\n    var qpCache = router._queryParamsFor(routeInfos);\n\n    for (var key in queryParams) {\n      if (!queryParams.hasOwnProperty(key)) {\n        continue;\n      }\n\n      var value = queryParams[key];\n      var qp = qpCache.map[key];\n      callback(key, value, qp);\n    }\n  }\n\n  function findLiveRoute(liveRoutes, name) {\n    if (!liveRoutes) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    var stack = [liveRoutes];\n\n    while (stack.length > 0) {\n      var test = stack.shift();\n\n      if (test.render.name === name) {\n        return test;\n      }\n\n      var outlets = test.outlets;\n\n      for (var outletName in outlets) {\n        stack.push(outlets[outletName]);\n      }\n    }\n\n    return;\n  }\n\n  function appendLiveRoute(liveRoutes, defaultParentState, renderOptions) {\n    var target;\n    var myState = {\n      render: renderOptions,\n      outlets: Object.create(null),\n      wasUsed: false\n    };\n\n    if (renderOptions.into) {\n      target = findLiveRoute(liveRoutes, renderOptions.into);\n    } else {\n      target = defaultParentState;\n    }\n\n    if (target) {\n      (0, _metal.set)(target.outlets, renderOptions.outlet, myState);\n    } else {\n      liveRoutes = myState;\n    }\n\n    return {\n      liveRoutes: liveRoutes,\n      ownState: myState\n    };\n  }\n\n  function representEmptyRoute(liveRoutes, defaultParentState, route) {\n    // the route didn't render anything\n    var alreadyAppended = findLiveRoute(liveRoutes, route.routeName);\n\n    if (alreadyAppended) {\n      // But some other route has already rendered our default\n      // template, so that becomes the default target for any\n      // children we may have.\n      return alreadyAppended;\n    } else {\n      // Create an entry to represent our default template name,\n      // just so other routes can target it and inherit its place\n      // in the outlet hierarchy.\n      defaultParentState.outlets.main = {\n        render: {\n          name: route.routeName,\n          outlet: 'main'\n        },\n        outlets: {}\n      };\n      return defaultParentState;\n    }\n  }\n\n  EmberRouter.reopen(_runtime.Evented, {\n    /**\n      Handles updating the paths and notifying any listeners of the URL\n      change.\n         Triggers the router level `didTransition` hook.\n         For example, to notify google analytics when the route changes,\n      you could use this hook.

For\n        example, in the above example, the `fullName` property depends on\n        `firstName` and `lastName` to determine its value. You can tell Ember\n        about these dependencies like this:\n         ```app/utils/president.js\n        import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n         export default EmberObject.extend({\n          firstName: '',\n          lastName:  '',\n           fullName: function() {\n            return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');\n             // Tell Ember.js that this computed property depends on firstName\n            // and lastName\n          }.property('firstName', 'lastName')\n        });\n        ```\n         Make sure you list these dependencies so Ember knows when to update\n        bindings that connect to a computed property. Changing a dependency\n        will not immediately trigger an update of the computed property, but\n        will instead clear the cache so that it is updated when the next `get`\n        is called on the property.\n         See [ComputedProperty](/api/ember/release/classes/ComputedProperty), [@ember/object/computed](/api/ember/release/classes/@ember%2Fobject%2Fcomputed).\n         @method property\n        @for Function\n        @public\n      */\n      property: {\n        configurable: true,\n        enumerable: false,\n        writable: true,\n        value: function () {\n          return _metal.computed.apply(void 0, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).concat([this]));\n        }\n      },\n\n      /**\n        The `observes` extension of Javascript's Function prototype is available\n        when `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES` or `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES.Function` is\n        true, which is the default.\n         You can observe property changes simply by adding the `observes`\n        call to the end of your method declarations in classes that you write.\n        For example:\n         ```javascript\n        import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n         EmberObject.extend({\n          valueObserver: function() {\n            // Executes whenever the \"value\" property changes\n          }.observes('value')\n        });\n        ```\n         In the future this method may become asynchronous.\n         See `observer`.\n         @method observes\n        @for Function\n        @public\n      */\n      observes: {\n        configurable: true,\n        enumerable: false,\n        writable: true,\n        value: function () {\n          return _metal.observer.apply(void 0, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).concat([this]));\n        }\n      },\n\n      /**\n        The `on` extension of Javascript's Function prototype is available\n        when `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES` or `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES.Function` is\n        true, which is the default.\n         You can listen for events simply by adding the `on` call to the end of\n        your method declarations in classes or mixins that you write.

  the `actions` hash defined on extended parent classes\n      or mixins rather than just replace the entire hash, e.g.:\n       ```app/mixins/can-display-banner.js\n      import Mixin from '@ember/mixin';\n       export default Mixin.create({\n        actions: {\n          displayBanner(msg) {\n            // ...\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/welcome.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n      import CanDisplayBanner from '../mixins/can-display-banner';\n       export default Route.extend(CanDisplayBanner, {\n        actions: {\n          playMusic() {\n            // ...\n          }\n        }\n      });\n       // `WelcomeRoute`, when active, will be able to respond\n      // to both actions, since the

Route or Component's action handler,\n      the value of the `this` context is the Controller, Route or\n      Component object:\n       ```app/routes/song.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          myAction() {\n            this.controllerFor(\"song\");\n            this.transitionTo(\"other.route\");\n            ...\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       It is also possible to call `this._super(...arguments)` from within an\n      action handler if it overrides a handler defined on a parent\n      class or mixin:\n       Take for example the following routes:\n       ```app/mixins/debug-route.js\n      import Mixin from '@ember/mixin';\n       export default Mixin.create({\n        actions: {\n          debugRouteInformation() {\n            console.debug(\"It's a-me, console.debug!\");\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/annoying-debug.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n      import DebugRoute from '../mixins/debug-route';\n       export default Route.extend(DebugRoute, {\n        actions: {\n          debugRouteInformation() {\n            // also call the debugRouteInformation of mixed in DebugRoute\n            this._super(...arguments);\n             // show additional annoyance\n            window.alert(...);\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ## Bubbling\n       By default, an action will stop bubbling once a handler defined\n      on the `actions` hash handles it. To continue bubbling the action,\n      you must return `true` from the handler:\n       ```app/router.js\n      Router.map(function() {\n        this.route(\"album\", function() {\n          this.route(\"song\");\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/album.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          startPlaying: function() {\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/album-song.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          startPlaying() {\n            // ...\n             if (actionShouldAlsoBeTriggeredOnParentRoute) {\n              return true;\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       @property actions\n      @type Object\n      @default null\n      @public\n    */\n\n    /**\n      Triggers a named action on the `ActionHandler`.

You can also be notified whenever the\n    membership of an array changes by using `.observes('myArray.[]')`.\n  \n    To support `EmberArray` in your own class, you must override two\n    primitives to use it: `length()` and `objectAt()`.\n  \n    @class EmberArray\n    @uses Enumerable\n    @since Ember 0.9.0\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  var ArrayMixin = _metal.Mixin.create(_enumerable.default, (_Mixin$create = {}, _Mixin$create[EMBER_ARRAY] = true, _Mixin$create.objectsAt = function (indexes) {\n    var _this = this;\n\n    return indexes.map(function (idx) {\n      return (0, _metal.objectAt)(_this, idx);\n    });\n  }, _Mixin$create['[]'] = nonEnumerableComputed({\n    get: function () {\n      return this;\n    },\n    set: function (key, value) {\n      this.replace(0, this.length, value);\n      return this;\n    }\n  }), _Mixin$create.firstObject = nonEnumerableComputed(function () {\n    return (0, _metal.objectAt)(this, 0);\n  }).readOnly(), _Mixin$create.lastObject = nonEnumerableComputed(function () {\n    return (0, _metal.objectAt)(this, this.length - 1);\n  }).readOnly(), _Mixin$create.slice = function () {\n    var beginIndex = arguments.length > 0 && arguments[0] !== undefined ?

This allows the observing objects to be notified and\n    computed properties to be handled properly.\n  \n    More documentation about `get` and `set` are below.\n  \n    ## Observing Property Changes\n  \n    You typically observe property changes simply by using the `observer`\n    function in classes that you write.\n  \n    For example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { observer } from '@ember/object';\n    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n  \n    EmberObject.extend({\n      valueObserver: observer('value', function(sender, key, value, rev) {\n        // Executes whenever the \"value\" property changes\n        // See the addObserver method for more information about the callback arguments\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Although this is the most common way to add an observer, this capability\n    is actually built into the `EmberObject` class on top of two methods\n    defined in this mixin: `addObserver` and `removeObserver`. You can use\n    these two methods to add and remove observers yourself if you need to\n    do so at runtime.\n  \n    To add an observer for a property, call:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    object.addObserver('propertyKey', targetObject, targetAction)\n    ```\n  \n    This will call the `targetAction` method on the `targetObject` whenever\n    the value of the `propertyKey` changes.\n  \n    Note that if `propertyKey` is a computed property, the observer will be\n    called when any of the property dependencies are changed, even if the\n    resulting value of the computed property is unchanged. This is necessary\n    because computed properties are not computed until `get` is called.\n  \n    @class Observable\n    @public\n  */\n  var _default = _metal.Mixin.create({\n    /**\n      Retrieves the value of a property from the object.\n       This method is usually similar to using `object[keyName]` or `object.keyName`,\n      however it supports both computed properties and the unknownProperty\n      handler.\n       Because `get` unifies the syntax for accessing all these kinds\n      of properties, it can make many refactorings easier, such as replacing a\n      simple property with a computed property, or vice versa.\n       ### Computed Properties\n       Computed properties are methods defined with the `property` modifier\n      declared at the end, such as:\n       ```javascript\n      import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n       fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {\n        return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');\n      })\n      ```\n       When you call `get` on a computed property, the function will be\n      called and the return value will be returned instead of the function\n      itself.\n       ### Unknown Properties\n       Likewise, if you try to call `get` on a property whose value is\n      `undefined`, the `unknownProperty()` method will be called on the object.\n      If this method returns any value other than `undefined`, it will be returned\n      instead. This allows you to implement \"virtual\" properties that are\n      not defined upfront.\n       @method get\n      @param {String} keyName The property to retrieve\n      @return {Object} The property value or undefined.\n      @public\n    */\n    get: function (keyName) {\n      return (0, _metal.get)(this, keyName);\n    },\n\n    /**\n      To get the values of multiple properties at once, call `getProperties`\n      with a list of strings or an array:\n       ```javascript\n      record.getProperties('firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode');\n      // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', zipCode: '10011' }\n      ```\n       is equivalent to:\n       ```javascript\n      record.getProperties(['firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode']);\n      // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', zipCode: '10011' }\n      ```\n       @method getProperties\n      @param {String...|Array} list of keys to get\n      @return {Object}\n      @public\n    */\n    getProperties: function () {\n      for (var _len = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n        args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n      }\n\n      return _metal.getProperties.apply(void 0, [this].concat(args));\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Sets the provided key or path to the value.\n       ```javascript\n      record.set(\"key\", value);\n      ```\n       This method is generally very similar to calling `object[\"key\"] = value` or\n      `object.key = value`, except that it provides support for computed\n      properties, the `setUnknownProperty()` method and property observers.\n       ### Computed Properties\n       If you try to set a value on a key that has a computed property handler\n      defined (see the `get()` method for an example), then `set()` will call\n      that method, passing both the value and key instead of simply changing\n      the value itself. This is useful for those times when you need to\n      implement a property that is composed of one or more member\n      properties.\n       ### Unknown Properties\n       If you try to set a value on a key that is undefined in the target\n      object, then the `setUnknownProperty()` handler will be called instead. This\n      gives you an opportunity to implement complex \"virtual\" properties that\n      are not predefined on the object. If `setUnknownProperty()` returns\n      undefined, then `set()` will simply set the value on the object.\n       ### Property Observers\n       In addition to changing the property, `set()` will also register a property\n      change with the object. Unless you have placed this call inside of a\n      `beginPropertyChanges()` and `endPropertyChanges(),` any \"local\" observers\n      (i.e. observer methods declared on the same object), will be called\n      immediately.

The `key` is the property that\n      changes. The `value` property is currently reserved and unused. The `rev`\n      is the last property revision of the object when it changed, which you can\n      use to detect if the key value has really changed or not.\n       Usually you will not need the value or revision parameters at\n      the end. In this case, it is common to write observer methods that take\n      only a sender and key value as parameters or, if you aren't interested in\n      any of these values, to write an observer that has no parameters at all.\n       @method addObserver\n      @param {String} key The key to observe\n      @param {Object} target The target object to invoke\n      @param {String|Function} method The method to invoke\n      @return {Observable}\n      @public\n    */\n    addObserver: function (key, target, method) {\n      (0, _metal.addObserver)(this, key, target, method);\n      return this;\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Remove an observer you have previously registered on this object.

You must continue to use the `create` method\n      when making new instances of classes, even if they are defined using native\n      class syntax. If you want to use `new` syntax, consider creating classes\n      which do _not_ extend from `EmberObject` or `CoreObject`. Ember features,\n      such as computed properties and decorators, will still work with base-less\n      classes.\n    * Instead of using `this._super()`, you must use standard `super` syntax in\n      native classes. See the [MDN docs on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Super_class_calls_with_super)\n      for more details.\n    * Native classes support using [constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Constructor)\n      to set up newly-created instances. Ember uses these to, among other things,\n      support features that need to retrieve other entities by name, like Service\n      injection and `getOwner`. To ensure your custom instance setup logic takes\n      place after this important work is done, avoid using the `constructor` in\n      favor of `init`.\n    * Properties passed to `create` will be available on the instance by the time\n      `init` runs, so any code that requires these values should work at that\n      time.\n    * Using native classes, and switching back to the old Ember Object model is\n      fully supported.\n  \n    @class CoreObject\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  var CoreObject =\n  /*#__PURE__*/\n  function () {\n    CoreObject._initFactory = function _initFactory(factory) {\n      factoryMap.set(this, factory);\n    };\n\n    function CoreObject(properties) {\n      // pluck off factory\n      var initFactory = factoryMap.get(this.constructor);\n\n      if (initFactory !== undefined) {\n        factoryMap.delete(this.constructor);\n\n        _container.FACTORY_FOR.set(this, initFactory);\n      } // prepare prototype...\n\n\n      this.constructor.proto();\n      var self = this;\n\n      if (false\n      /* DEBUG */\n      && _utils.HAS_NATIVE_PROXY && typeof self.unknownProperty === 'function') {\n        var messageFor = function (obj, property) {\n          return \"You attempted to access the `\" + String(property) + \"` property (of \" + obj + \").\\n\" + \"Since Ember 3.1, this is usually fine as you no longer need to use `.get()`\\n\" + \"to access computed properties.

However, there are some cases where it is preferable\n      to build up a property's value by combining the superclass' property\n      value with the subclass' value. An example of this in use within Ember\n      is the `classNames` property of `Ember.View`.\n       Here is some sample code showing the difference between a concatenated\n      property and a normal one:\n       ```javascript\n      import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n       const Bar = EmberObject.extend({\n        // Configure which properties to concatenate\n        concatenatedProperties: ['concatenatedProperty'],\n         someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['bar'],\n        concatenatedProperty: ['bar']\n      });\n       const FooBar = Bar.extend({\n        someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['foo'],\n        concatenatedProperty: ['foo']\n      });\n       let fooBar = FooBar.create();\n      fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['foo']\n      fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo']\n      ```\n       This behavior extends to object creation as well. Continuing the\n      above example:\n       ```javascript\n      let fooBar = FooBar.create({\n        someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['baz'],\n        concatenatedProperty: ['baz']\n      })\n      fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['baz']\n      fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']\n      ```\n       Adding a single property that is not an array will just add it in the array:\n       ```javascript\n      let fooBar = FooBar.create({\n        concatenatedProperty: 'baz'\n      })\n      view.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']\n      ```\n       Using the `concatenatedProperties` property, we can tell Ember to mix the\n      content of the properties.\n       In `Component` the `classNames`, `classNameBindings` and\n      `attributeBindings` properties are concatenated.\n       This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,\n      although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently.

An example of this in use within Ember\n      is the `queryParams` property of routes.\n       Here is some sample code showing the difference between a merged\n      property and a normal one:\n       ```javascript\n      import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n       const Bar = EmberObject.extend({\n        // Configure which properties are to be merged\n        mergedProperties: ['mergedProperty'],\n         someNonMergedProperty: {\n          nonMerged: 'superclass value of nonMerged'\n        },\n        mergedProperty: {\n          page: { replace: false },\n          limit: { replace: true }\n        }\n      });\n       const FooBar = Bar.extend({\n        someNonMergedProperty: {\n          completelyNonMerged: 'subclass value of nonMerged'\n        },\n        mergedProperty: {\n          limit: { replace: false }\n        }\n      });\n       let fooBar = FooBar.create();\n       fooBar.get('someNonMergedProperty');\n      // => { completelyNonMerged: 'subclass value of nonMerged' }\n      //\n      // Note the entire object, including the nonMerged property of\n      // the superclass object, has been replaced\n       fooBar.get('mergedProperty');\n      // => {\n      //   page: {replace: false},\n      //   limit: {replace: false}\n      // }\n      //\n      // Note the page remains from the superclass, and the\n      // `limit` property's value of `false` has been merged from\n      // the subclass.\n      ```\n       This behavior is not available during object `create` calls. It is only\n      available at `extend` time.\n       In `Route` the `queryParams` property is merged.\n       This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,\n      although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently. Since\n      it changes expectations about behavior of properties, you should properly\n      document its usage in each individual merged property (to not\n      mislead your users to think they can override the property in a subclass).\n       @property mergedProperties\n      @type Array\n      @default null\n      @public\n    */\n\n    /**\n      Destroyed object property flag.\n       if this property is `true` the observers and bindings were already\n      removed by the effect of calling the `destroy()` method.\n       @property isDestroyed\n      @default false\n      @public\n    */\n    ;\n    /**\n      Destroys an object by setting the `isDestroyed` flag and removing its\n      metadata, which effectively destroys observers and bindings.\n       If you try to set a property on a destroyed object, an exception will be\n      raised.\n       Note that destruction is scheduled for the end of the run loop and does not\n      happen immediately.

Any instance\n      of the `Person` class will *not* have the `march()` method.\n       You can also pass `Mixin` classes to add additional properties to the subclass.\n       ```javascript\n      import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n      import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';\n       const Person = EmberObject.extend({\n        say(thing) {\n          alert(`${this.get('name')} says: ${thing}`);\n        }\n      });\n       const SingingMixin = Mixin.create({\n        sing(thing) {\n          alert(`${this.get('name')} sings: la la la ${thing}`);\n        }\n      });\n       const BroadwayStar = Person.extend(SingingMixin, {\n        dance() {\n          alert(`${this.get('name')} dances: tap tap tap tap `);\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       The `BroadwayStar` class contains three methods: `say()`, `sing()`, and `dance()`.\n       @method extend\n      @static\n      @for @ember/object\n      @param {Mixin} [mixins]* One or more Mixin classes\n      @param {Object} [arguments]* Object containing values to use within the new class\n      @public\n    */\n    ;\n\n    CoreObject.extend = function extend() {\n      var Class =\n      /*#__PURE__*/\n      function (_this) {\n        (0, _emberBabel.inheritsLoose)(Class, _this);\n\n        function Class() {\n          return _this.apply(this, arguments) || this;\n        }\n\n        return Class;\n      }(this);\n\n      _reopen.apply(Class.PrototypeMixin, arguments);\n\n      return Class;\n    }\n    /**\n      Creates an instance of a class.

For example, `controller:post` looks up\n      `App.PostController` by default.\n    * there are some nuances (see examples below)\n  \n    ### How Resolving Works\n  \n    The container calls this object's `resolve` method with the\n    `fullName` argument.\n  \n    It first parses the fullName into an object using `parseName`.\n  \n    Then it checks for the presence of a type-specific instance\n    method of the form `resolve[Type]` and calls it if it exists.\n    For example if it was resolving 'template:post', it would call\n    the `resolveTemplate` method.\n  \n    Its last resort is to call the `resolveOther` method.\n  \n    The methods of this object are designed to be easy to override\n    in a subclass. For example, you could enhance how a template\n    is resolved like so:\n  \n    ```app/app.js\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n    import GlobalsResolver from '@ember/application/globals-resolver';\n  \n    App = Application.create({\n      Resolver: GlobalsResolver.extend({\n        resolveTemplate(parsedName) {\n          let resolvedTemplate = this._super(parsedName);\n          if (resolvedTemplate) { return resolvedTemplate; }\n  \n          return Ember.TEMPLATES['not_found'];\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Some examples of how names are resolved:\n  \n    ```text\n    'template:post'           //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['post']\n    'template:posts/byline'   //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['posts/byline']\n    'template:posts.byline'   //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['posts/byline']\n    'template:blogPost'       //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['blog-post']\n    'controller:post'         //=> App.PostController\n    'controller:posts.index'  //=> App.PostsIndexController\n    'controller:blog/post'    //=> Blog.PostController\n    'controller:basic'        //=> Controller\n    'route:post'              //=> App.PostRoute\n    'route:posts.index'       //=> App.PostsIndexRoute\n    'route:blog/post'         //=> Blog.PostRoute\n    'route:basic'             //=> Route\n    'foo:post'                //=> App.PostFoo\n    'model:post'              //=> App.Post\n    ```\n  \n    @class GlobalsResolver\n    @extends EmberObject\n    @public\n  */\n  var DefaultResolver =\n  /*#__PURE__*/\n  function (_EmberObject) {\n    (0, _emberBabel.inheritsLoose)(DefaultResolver, _EmberObject);\n\n    function DefaultResolver() {\n      return _EmberObject.apply(this, arguments) || this;\n    }\n\n    DefaultResolver.create = function create(props) {\n      // DO NOT REMOVE even though this doesn't do anything\n      // This is required for a FireFox 60+ JIT bug with our tests.\n      // without it, create(props) in our tests would lose props on a deopt.\n      return _EmberObject.create.call(this, props);\n    }\n    /**\n      This will be set to the Application instance when it is\n      created.\n       @property namespace\n      @public\n    */\n    ;\n\n    var _proto = DefaultResolver.prototype;\n\n    _proto.init = function init() {\n      this._parseNameCache = (0, _utils.dictionary)(null);\n    };\n\n    _proto.normalize = function normalize(fullName) {\n      var _fullName$split = fullName.split(':'),\n          type = _fullName$split[0],\n          name = _fullName$split[1];\n\n      false && !(fullName.split(':').length === 2) && (0, _debug.assert)('Tried to normalize a container name without a colon (:) in it.

It helps to instantiate, initialize and coordinate the many\n    objects that make up your app.\n  \n    Each Ember app has one and only one `Application` object. In fact, the\n    very first thing you should do in your application is create the instance:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    window.App = Application.create();\n    ```\n  \n    Typically, the application object is the only global variable. All other\n    classes in your app should be properties on the `Application` instance,\n    which highlights its first role: a global namespace.\n  \n    For example, if you define a view class, it might look like this:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    App.MyView = Ember.View.extend();\n    ```\n  \n    By default, calling `Application.create()` will automatically initialize\n    your application by calling the `Application.initialize()` method. If\n    you need to delay initialization, you can call your app's `deferReadiness()`\n    method. When you are ready for your app to be initialized, call its\n    `advanceReadiness()` method.\n  \n    You can define a `ready` method on the `Application` instance, which\n    will be run by Ember when the application is initialized.\n  \n    Because `Application` inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes\n    you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.\n    See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.\n  \n    While you can think of your `Application` as a container that holds the\n    other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities\n    going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand.\n  \n    ### Event Delegation\n  \n    Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework\n    to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to\n    do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own\n    `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`\n    listener on the `body`.\n  \n    If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and\n    start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking\n    their `mouseDown` method as it goes.\n  \n    `Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as\n    well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For\n    example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be\n    called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.\n  \n    If there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by\n    default, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method\n    names by setting the application's `customEvents` property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      customEvents: {\n        // add support for the paste event\n        paste: 'paste'\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    To prevent Ember from setting up a listener for a default event,\n    specify the event name with a `null` value in the `customEvents`\n    property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      customEvents: {\n        // prevent listeners for mouseenter/mouseleave events\n        mouseenter: null,\n        mouseleave: null\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document\n    body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside\n    an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element\n    inside the body.\n  \n    For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`\n    should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      rootElement: '#ember-app'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a jQuery-compatible selector\n    string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will\n    not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only\n    append views inside it!\n  \n    To learn more about the events Ember components use, see\n  \n    [components/handling-events](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/handling-events/#toc_event-names).\n  \n    ### Initializers\n  \n    Libraries on top of Ember can add initializers, like so:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    Application.initializer({\n      name: 'api-adapter',\n  \n      initialize: function(application) {\n        application.register('api-adapter:main', ApiAdapter);\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Initializers provide an opportunity to access the internal registry, which\n    organizes the different components of an Ember application. Additionally\n    they provide a chance to access the instantiated application. Beyond\n    being used for libraries, initializers are also a great way to organize\n    dependency injection or setup in your own application.\n  \n    ### Routing\n  \n    In addition to creating your application's router, `Application` is\n    also responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions\n    between routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more\n    detailed intra-transition logging can be logged with\n    the `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions\n      LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into\n    application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you\n    need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`\n    method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.\n  \n    If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a\n    `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing\n    begins.\n  \n    @class Application\n    @extends Engine\n    @uses RegistryProxyMixin\n    @public\n  */\n\n  var Application = _engine.default.extend({\n    /**\n      The root DOM element of the Application.

See the documentation on\n      `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.\n       `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` is an interface class that exists\n      purely to document the available options; you do not need to construct it\n      manually. Simply pass a regular JavaScript object containing of the\n      desired options:\n       ```javascript\n      MyApp.visit(\"/\", { location: \"none\", rootElement: \"#container\" });\n      ```\n       ### Supported Scenarios\n       While the `BootOptions` class exposes a large number of knobs, not all\n      combinations of them are valid; certain incompatible combinations might\n      result in unexpected behavior.\n       For example, booting the instance in the full browser environment\n      while specifying a foreign `document` object (e.g. `{ isBrowser: true,\n      document: iframe.contentDocument }`) does not work correctly today,\n      largely due to Ember's jQuery dependency.\n       Currently, there are three officially supported scenarios/configurations.\n      Usages outside of these scenarios are not guaranteed to work, but please\n      feel free to file bug reports documenting your experience and any issues\n      you encountered to help expand support.\n       #### Browser Applications (Manual Boot)\n       The setup is largely similar to how Ember works out-of-the-box. Normally,\n      Ember will boot a default instance for your Application on \"DOM ready\".\n      However, you can customize this behavior by disabling `autoboot`.\n       For example, this allows you to render a miniture demo of your application\n      into a specific area on your marketing website:\n       ```javascript\n      import MyApp from 'my-app';\n       $(function() {\n        let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });\n         let options = {\n          // Override the router's location adapter to prevent it from updating\n          // the URL in the address bar\n          location: 'none',\n           // Override the default `rootElement` on the app to render into a\n          // specific `div` on the page\n          rootElement: '#demo'\n        };\n         // Start the app at the special demo URL\n        App.visit('/demo', options);\n      });\n      ```\n       Or perhaps you might want to boot two instances of your app on the same\n      page for a split-screen multiplayer experience:\n       ```javascript\n      import MyApp from 'my-app';\n       $(function() {\n        let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });\n         let sessionId = MyApp.generateSessionID();\n         let player1 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+1&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#left', location: 'none' });\n        let player2 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+2&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#right', location: 'none' });\n         Promise.all([player1, player2]).then(() => {\n          // Both apps have completed the initial render\n          $('#loading').fadeOut();\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n       Do note that each app instance maintains their own registry/container, so\n      they will run in complete isolation by default.\n       #### Server-Side Rendering (also known as FastBoot)\n       This setup allows you to run your Ember app in a server environment using\n      Node.js and render its content into static HTML for SEO purposes.\n       ```javascript\n      const HTMLSerializer = new SimpleDOM.HTMLSerializer(SimpleDOM.voidMap);\n       function renderURL(url) {\n        let dom = new SimpleDOM.Document();\n        let rootElement = dom.body;\n        let options = { isBrowser: false, document: dom, rootElement: rootElement };\n         return MyApp.visit(options).then(instance => {\n          try {\n            return HTMLSerializer.serialize(rootElement.firstChild);\n          } finally {\n            instance.destroy();\n          }\n        });\n      }\n      ```\n       In this scenario, because Ember does not have access to a global `document`\n      object in the Node.js environment, you must provide one explicitly. In practice,\n      in the non-browser environment, the stand-in `document` object only needs to\n      implement a limited subset of the full DOM API. The `SimpleDOM` library is known\n      to work.\n       Since there is no access to jQuery in the non-browser environment, you must also\n      specify a DOM `Element` object in the same `document` for the `rootElement` option\n      (as opposed to a selector string like `\"body\"`).\n       See the documentation on the `isBrowser`, `document` and `rootElement` properties\n      on `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.\n       #### Server-Side Resource Discovery\n       This setup allows you to run the routing layer of your Ember app in a server\n      environment using Node.js and completely disable rendering. This allows you\n      to simulate and discover the resources (i.e. AJAX requests) needed to fulfill\n      a given request and eagerly \"push\" these resources to the client.\n       ```app/initializers/network-service.js\n      import BrowserNetworkService from 'app/services/network/browser';\n      import NodeNetworkService from 'app/services/network/node';\n       // Inject a (hypothetical) service for abstracting all AJAX calls and use\n      // the appropriate implementation on the client/server. This also allows the\n      // server to log all the AJAX calls made during a particular request and use\n      // that for resource-discovery purpose.\n       export function initialize(application) {\n        if (window) { // browser\n          application.register('service:network', BrowserNetworkService);\n        } else { // node\n          application.register('service:network', NodeNetworkService);\n        }\n         application.inject('route', 'network', 'service:network');\n      };\n       export default {\n        name: 'network-service',\n        initialize: initialize\n      };\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/post.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       // An example of how the (hypothetical) service is used in routes.\n       export default Route.extend({\n        model(params) {\n          return this.network.fetch(`/api/posts/${params.post_id}.json`);\n        },\n         afterModel(post) {\n          if (post.isExternalContent) {\n            return this.network.fetch(`/api/external/?url=${post.externalURL}`);\n          } else {\n            return post;\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```javascript\n      // Finally, put all the pieces together\n       function discoverResourcesFor(url) {\n        return MyApp.visit(url, { isBrowser: false, shouldRender: false }).then(instance => {\n          let networkService = instance.lookup('service:network');\n          return networkService.requests; // => { \"/api/posts/123.json\": \"...\" }\n        });\n      }\n      ```\n       @public\n      @method visit\n      @param url {String} The initial URL to navigate to\n      @param options {ApplicationInstance.BootOptions}\n      @return {Promise<ApplicationInstance, Error>}\n    */\n    visit: function (url, options) {\n      var _this = this;\n\n      return this.boot().then(function () {\n        var instance = _this.buildInstance();\n\n        return instance.boot(options).then(function () {\n          return instance.visit(url);\n        }).catch(function (error) {\n          (0, _runloop.run)(instance, 'destroy');\n          throw error;\n        });\n      });\n    }\n  });\n\n  Application.reopenClass({\n    /**\n      This creates a registry with the default Ember naming conventions.\n       It also configures the registry:\n       * registered views are created every time they are looked up (they are\n        not singletons)\n      * registered templates are not factories;

also binds the function directly to the instance, so it can be used in any\n    context and will correctly refer to the class it came from:\n  \n    ```hbs\n    <!-- template.hbs -->\n    <button\n      {{did-insert this.toggleShowing}}\n      {{on \"click\" this.toggleShowing}}\n    >\n      Show tooltip\n    </button>\n  \n    {{#if isShowing}}\n      <div class=\"tooltip\">\n        I'm a tooltip!\n      </div>\n    {{/if}}\n    ```\n  \n    This can also be used in JavaScript code directly:\n  \n    ```js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n    import { action, set } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default class Tooltip extends Component {\n      constructor() {\n        super(...arguments);\n  \n        // this.toggleShowing is still bound correctly when added

By contrast, the `{{action}}` helper\n    and modifier can also be used to bind context, but it will be required for\n    every usage of the method:\n  \n    ```hbs\n    <!-- template.hbs -->\n    <button\n      {{did-insert (action this.toggleShowing)}}\n      {{on \"click\" (action this.toggleShowing)}}\n    >\n      Show tooltip\n    </button>\n  \n    {{#if isShowing}}\n      <div class=\"tooltip\">\n        I'm a tooltip!\n      </div>\n    {{/if}}\n    ```\n  \n    They also do not have equivalents in JavaScript directly, so they cannot be\n    used for other situations where binding would be useful.\n  \n    @method action\n    @category EMBER_NATIVE_DECORATOR_SUPPORT\n    @for @ember/object\n    @static\n    @param {} elementDesc the descriptor of the element to decorate\n    @return {ElementDescriptor} the decorated descriptor\n    @private\n  */\n  var action;\n  _exports.action = action;\n\n  if (true\n  /* EMBER_NATIVE_DECORATOR_SUPPORT */\n  ) {\n      var BINDINGS_MAP = new WeakMap();\n\n      var setupAction = function (target, key, actionFn) {\n        if (target.constructor !== undefined && typeof target.constructor.proto === 'function') {\n          target.constructor.proto();\n        }\n\n        if (!target.hasOwnProperty('actions')) {\n          var parentActions = target.actions; // we need to assign because of the way mixins copy actions down when inheriting\n\n          target.actions = parentActions ?

// [{ name:'Release', priority:1 }, { name:'Unit Test', priority:2 }, { name:'Documentation', priority:3 }]\n    ```\n  \n    You can also optionally pass an array of additional dependent keys as the\n    second parameter, if your sort function is dependent on additional values that\n    could changes:\n  \n    ```js\n    import EmberObject, { set } from '@ember/object';\n    import { sort } from '@ember/object/computed';\n  \n    class ToDoList {\n      sortKey = 'priority';\n  \n      constructor(todos) {\n        set(this, 'todos', todos);\n      }\n  \n      // using a custom sort function\n      @sort('todos', ['sortKey'], function(a, b){\n        if (a[this.sortKey] > b[this.sortKey]) {\n          return 1;\n        } else if (a[this.sortKey] < b[this.sortKey]) {\n          return -1;\n        }\n  \n        return 0;\n      })\n      sortedTodos;\n    });\n  \n    let todoList = new ToDoList([\n      { name: 'Unit Test', priority: 2 },\n      { name: 'Documentation', priority: 3 },\n      { name: 'Release', priority: 1 }\n    ]);\n  \n    todoList.priorityTodos; // [{ name:'Release', priority:1 }, { name:'Unit Test', priority:2 }, { name:'Documentation', priority:3 }]\n    ```\n  \n    In the second form, you should provide the key of the array of sort values as\n    the second parameter:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { set } from '@ember/object';\n    import { sort } from '@ember/object/computed';\n  \n    class ToDoList {\n      constructor(todos) {\n        set(this, 'todos', todos);\n      }\n  \n      // using standard ascending sort\n      todosSorting = ['name'];\n      @sort('todos', 'todosSorting') sortedTodos;\n  \n      // using descending sort\n      todosSortingDesc = ['name:desc'];\n      @sort('todos', 'todosSortingDesc') sortedTodosDesc;\n    }\n  \n    let todoList = new ToDoList([\n      { name: 'Unit Test', priority: 2 },\n      { name: 'Documentation', priority: 3 },\n      { name: 'Release', priority: 1 }\n    ]);\n  \n    todoList.sortedTodos;

The\n    primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n    registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n    why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n  \n    Terminology\n    -----------\n  \n    - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n    - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n    - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n    - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n    - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n    - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n  \n    A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n  \n    Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n    state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n    rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n  \n    Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n    promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n    settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n    itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n    itself fulfill.\n  \n  \n    Basic Usage:\n    ------------\n  \n    ```js\n    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n      // on success\n      resolve(value);\n  \n      // on failure\n      reject(reason);\n    });\n  \n    promise.then(function(value) {\n      // on fulfillment\n    }, function(reason) {\n      // on rejection\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Advanced Usage:\n    ---------------\n  \n    Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n    `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n  \n    ```js\n    function getJSON(url) {\n      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n        let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  \n        xhr.open('GET', url);\n        xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n        xhr.responseType = 'json';\n        xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n        xhr.send();\n  \n        function handler() {\n          if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n            if (this.status === 200) {\n              resolve(this.response);\n            } else {\n              reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n            }\n          }\n        };\n      });\n    }\n  \n    getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n      // on fulfillment\n    }, function(reason) {\n      // on rejection\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n  \n    ```js\n    Promise.all([\n      getJSON('/posts'),\n      getJSON('/comments')\n    ]).then(function(values){\n      values[0] // => postsJSON\n      values[1] // => commentsJSON\n  \n      return values;\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @class Promise\n    @public\n    @param {function} resolver\n    @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @constructor\n  */\n\n\n  var Promise =\n  /*#__PURE__*/\n  function () {\n    function Promise(resolver, label) {\n      this._id = counter++;\n      this._label = label;\n      this._state = undefined;\n      this._result = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n      config.instrument && instrument('created', this);\n\n      if (noop !== resolver) {\n        typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n        this instanceof Promise ?

You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the\n    browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,\n    `denodeify` transforms the following:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n  \n    fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n      if (err) return handleError(err);\n      handleData(data);\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    into:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n    let readFile = denodeify(fs.readFile);\n  \n    readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);\n    ```\n  \n    If the node function has multiple success parameters, then `denodeify`\n    just returns the first one:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = denodeify(require('request'));\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(res) {\n      // ...\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    However, if you need all success parameters, setting `denodeify`'s\n    second parameter to `true` causes it to return all success parameters\n    as an array:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = denodeify(require('request'), true);\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n      // result[0] -> res\n      // result[1] -> body\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Or if you pass it an array with names it returns the parameters as a hash:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = denodeify(require('request'), ['res', 'body']);\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n      // result.res\n      // result.body\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Sometimes you need to retain the `this`:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let app = require('express')();\n    let render = denodeify(app.render.bind(app));\n    ```\n  \n    The denodified function inherits from the original function. It works in all\n    environments, except IE 10 and below. Consequently all properties of the original\n    function are available to you. However, any properties you change on the\n    denodeified function won't be changed on the original function. Example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = denodeify(require('request')),\n        cookieJar = request.jar(); // <- Inheritance is used here\n  \n    request('http://example.com', {jar: cookieJar}).then(function(res) {\n      // cookieJar.cookies holds now the cookies returned by example.com\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead\n    of using callbacks. For example, instead of:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n  \n    fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n      if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n      fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){\n        if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n        console.log('done')\n      });\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    you can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n    let readFile = denodeify(fs.readFile);\n    let writeFile = denodeify(fs.writeFile);\n  \n    readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){\n      return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);\n    }).then(function(){\n      console.log('done')\n    }).catch(function(error){\n      // Handle error\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method denodeify\n    @public\n    @static\n    @for rsvp\n    @param {Function} nodeFunc a 'node-style' function that takes a callback as\n    its last argument.

A component is made up of a template and, optionally, this component\n   * object.\n   *\n   * ## Defining a Component\n   *\n   * To define a component, subclass `Component` and add your own properties,\n   * methods and lifecycle hooks:\n   *\n   * ```ts\n   * import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n   *\n   * export default class extends Component {\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ## Lifecycle Hooks\n   *\n   * Lifecycle hooks allow you to respond to changes to a component, such as when\n   * it gets created, rendered, updated or destroyed. To add a lifecycle hook to a\n   * component, implement the hook as a method on your component subclass.\n   *\n   * For example, to be notified when Glimmer has rendered your component so you\n   * can attach a legacy jQuery plugin, implement the `didInsertElement()` method:\n   *\n   * ```ts\n   * import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n   *\n   * export default class extends Component {\n   *   didInsertElement() {\n   *     $(this.element).pickadate();\n   *   }\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ## Data for Templates\n   *\n   * `Component`s have two different kinds of data, or state, that can be\n   * displayed in templates:\n   *\n   * 1. Arguments\n   * 2. Properties\n   *\n   * Arguments are data that is passed in to a component from its parent\n   * component. For example, if I have a `UserGreeting` component, I can pass it\n   * a name and greeting to use:\n   *\n   * ```hbs\n   * <UserGreeting @name=\"Ricardo\" @greeting=\"Olá\" />\n   * ```\n   *\n   * Inside my `UserGreeting` template, I can access the `@name` and `@greeting`\n   * arguments that I've been given:\n   *\n   * ```hbs\n   * {{@greeting}}, {{@name}}!\n   * ```\n   *\n   * Arguments are also available inside my component:\n   *\n   * ```ts\n   * console.log(this.args.greeting); // prints \"Olá\"\n   * ```\n   *\n   * Properties, on the other hand, are internal to the component and declared in\n   * the class. You can use properties to store data that you want to show in the\n   * template, or pass to another component as an argument.\n   *\n   * ```ts\n   * import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n   *\n   * export default class extends Component {\n   *   user = {\n   *     name: 'Robbie'\n   *   }\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * In the above example, we've defined a component with a `user` property that\n   * contains an object with its own `name` property.\n   *\n   * We can render that property in our template:\n   *\n   * ```hbs\n   * Hello, {{user.name}}!\n   * ```\n   *\n   * We can also take that property and pass it as an argument to the\n   * `UserGreeting` component we defined above:\n   *\n   * ```hbs\n   * <UserGreeting @greeting=\"Hello\" @name={{user.name}} />\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ## Arguments vs. Properties\n   *\n   * Remember, arguments are data that was given to your component by its parent\n   * component, and properties are data your component has defined for itself.\n   *\n   * You can tell the difference between arguments and properties in templates\n   * because arguments always start with an `@` sign (think \"A is for arguments\"):\n   *\n   * ```hbs\n   * {{@firstName}}\n   * ```\n   *\n   * We know that `@firstName` came from the parent component, not the current\n   * component, because it starts with `@` and is therefore an argument.\n   *\n   * On the other hand, if we see:\n   *\n   * ```hbs\n   * {{name}}\n   * ```\n   *\n   * We know that `name` is a property on the component. If we want to know where\n   * the data is coming from, we can go look at our component class to find out.\n   *\n   * Inside the component itself, arguments always show up inside the component's\n   * `args` property. For example, if `{{@firstName}}` is `Tom` in the template,\n   * inside the component `this.args.firstName` would also be `Tom`.\n   */\n  var GlimmerComponent =\n  /*#__PURE__*/\n  function () {\n    /**\n     * Constructs a new component and assigns itself the passed properties.
