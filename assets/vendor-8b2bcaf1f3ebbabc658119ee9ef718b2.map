Properties accessed in its templates go\n      to the view object and actions are targeted at\n      the view object. There is no access to the\n      surrounding context or outer controller; all\n      contextual information must be passed in.\n    \n      The easiest way to create a `Component` is via\n      a template. If you name a template\n      `app/templates/components/my-foo.hbs`, you will be able to use\n      `{{my-foo}}` in other templates, which will make\n      an instance of the isolated component.\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/my-foo.hbs\n      {{person-profile person=currentUser}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n      <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n      <img src={{person.avatar}}>\n      <p class='signature'>{{person.signature}}</p>\n      ```\n    \n      You can use `yield` inside a template to\n      include the **contents** of any block attached to\n      the component. The block will be executed in the\n      context of the surrounding context or outer controller:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#person-profile person=currentUser}}\n        <p>Admin mode</p>\n        {{! Executed in the controller's context. }}\n      {{/person-profile}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n      <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n      {{! Executed in the component's context. }}\n      {{yield}} {{! block contents }}\n      ```\n    \n      If you want to customize the component, in order to\n      handle events or actions, you implement a subclass\n      of `Component` named after the name of the\n      component.\n    \n      For example, you could implement the action\n      `hello` for the `person-profile` component:\n    \n      ```app/components/person-profile.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        actions: {\n          hello(name) {\n            console.log(\"Hello\", name);\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      And then use it in the component's template:\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n      <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n      {{yield}} <!-- block contents -->\n      <button {{action 'hello' person.name}}>\n        Say Hello to {{person.name}}\n      </button>\n      ```\n    \n      Components must have a `-` in their name to avoid\n      conflicts with built-in controls that wrap HTML\n      elements. This is consistent with the same\n      requirement in web components.\n    \n      ## HTML Tag\n    \n      The default HTML tag name used for a component's DOM representation is `div`.\n      This can be customized by setting the `tagName` property.\n      The following component class:\n    \n      ```app/components/emphasized-paragraph.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        tagName: 'em'\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Would result in instances with the following HTML:\n    \n      ```html\n      <em id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></em>\n      ```\n    \n      ## HTML `class` Attribute\n    \n      The HTML `class` attribute of a component's tag can be set by providing a\n      `classNames` property that is set to an array of strings:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNames: ['my-class', 'my-other-class']\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view my-class my-other-class\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      `class` attribute values can also be set by providing a `classNameBindings`\n      property set to an array of properties names for the component. The return value\n      of these properties will be added as part of the value for the components's `class`\n      attribute. These properties can be computed properties:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n      import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNameBindings: ['propertyA', 'propertyB'],\n    \n        propertyA: 'from-a',\n        propertyB: computed(function() {\n          if (someLogic) { return 'from-b'; }\n        })\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view from-a from-b\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      If the value of a class name binding returns a boolean the property name\n      itself will be used as the class name if the property is true.\n      The class name will not be added if the value is `false` or `undefined`.\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNameBindings: ['hovered'],\n    \n        hovered: true\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view hovered\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      When using boolean class name bindings you can supply a string value other\n      than the property name for use as the `class` HTML attribute by appending the\n      preferred value after a \":\" character when defining the binding:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNameBindings: ['awesome:so-very-cool'],\n    \n        awesome: true\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view so-very-cool\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      Boolean value class name bindings whose property names are in a\n      camelCase-style format will be converted to a dasherized format:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNameBindings: ['isUrgent'],\n    \n        isUrgent: true\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view is-urgent\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      Class name bindings can also refer to object values that are found by\n      traversing a path relative to the component itself:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n      import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNameBindings: ['messages.empty'],\n    \n        messages: EmberObject.create({\n          empty: true\n        })\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view empty\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      If you want to add a class name for a property which evaluates to true and\n      and a different class name if it evaluates to false, you can pass a binding\n      like this:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNameBindings: ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled'],\n        isEnabled: true\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view enabled\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      When isEnabled is `false`, the resulting HTML representation looks like\n      this:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      This syntax offers the convenience to add a class if a property is `false`:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      // Applies no class when isEnabled is true and class 'disabled' when isEnabled is false\n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNameBindings: ['isEnabled::disabled'],\n        isEnabled: true\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      When the `isEnabled` property on the component is set to `false`, it will result\n      in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      Updates to the value of a class name binding will result in automatic\n      update of the  HTML `class` attribute in the component's rendered HTML\n      representation. If the value becomes `false` or `undefined` the class name\n      will be removed.\n      Both `classNames` and `classNameBindings` are concatenated properties. See\n      [EmberObject](/api/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more\n      information about concatenated properties.\n    \n      ## HTML Attributes\n    \n      The HTML attribute section of a component's tag can be set by providing an\n      `attributeBindings` property set to an array of property names on the component.\n      The return value of these properties will be used as the value of the component's\n      HTML associated attribute:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-anchor.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        tagName: 'a',\n        attributeBindings: ['href'],\n    \n        href: 'http://google.com'\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n      ```\n    \n      One property can be mapped on to another by placing a \":\" between\n      the source property and the destination property:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-anchor.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        tagName: 'a',\n        attributeBindings: ['url:href'],\n    \n        url: 'http://google.com'\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n      ```\n    \n      Namespaced attributes (e.g. `xlink:href`) are supported, but have to be\n      mapped, since `:` is not a valid character for properties in Javascript:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-use.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        tagName: 'use',\n        attributeBindings: ['xlinkHref:xlink:href'],\n    \n        xlinkHref: '#triangle'\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <use xlink:href=\"#triangle\"></use>\n      ```\n    \n      If the return value of an `attributeBindings` monitored property is a boolean\n      the attribute will be present or absent depending on the value:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        tagName: 'input',\n        attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n    \n        disabled: false\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in a component instance with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <input id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" />\n      ```\n    \n      `attributeBindings` can refer to computed properties:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n      import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        tagName: 'input',\n        attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n    \n        disabled: computed(function() {\n          if (someLogic) {\n            return true;\n          } else {\n            return false;\n          }\n        })\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      To prevent setting an attribute altogether, use `null` or `undefined` as the\n      return value of the `attributeBindings` monitored property:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        tagName: 'form',\n        attributeBindings: ['novalidate'],\n        novalidate: null\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Updates to the property of an attribute binding will result in automatic\n      update of the  HTML attribute in the component's rendered HTML representation.\n      `attributeBindings` is a concatenated property. See [EmberObject](/api/ember/release/classes/EmberObject)\n      documentation for more information about concatenated properties.\n    \n      ## Layouts\n    \n      See [Ember.Templates.helpers.yield](/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/yield?anchor=yield)\n      for more information.\n    \n      Layout can be used to wrap content in a component. In addition\n      to wrapping content in a Component's template, you can also use\n      the public layout API in your Component JavaScript.\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n        <h1>Person's Title</h1>\n        <div class='details'>{{yield}}</div>\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/components/person-profile.js\n        import Component from '@ember/component';\n        import layout from '../templates/components/person-profile';\n    \n        export default Component.extend({\n          layout\n        });\n      ```\n    \n      If you call the `person-profile` component like so:\n    \n      ```\n      {{#person-profile}}\n        <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n        <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n      {{/person-profile}}\n    \n      It will result in the following HTML output:\n    \n      ```html\n        <h1>Person's Title</h1>\n        <div class=\"details\">\n          <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n          <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n        </div>\n      ```\n    \n      ## Responding to Browser Events\n    \n      Components can respond to user-initiated events in one of three ways: method\n      implementation, through an event manager, and through `{{action}}` helper use\n      in their template or layout.\n    \n      ### Method Implementation\n    \n      Components can respond to user-initiated events by implementing a method that\n      matches the event name. A `jQuery.Event` object will be passed as the\n      argument to this method.\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        click(event) {\n          // will be called when an instance's\n          // rendered element is clicked\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ### `{{action}}` Helper\n    \n      See [Ember.Templates.helpers.action](/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/yield?anchor=yield).\n    \n      ### Event Names\n    \n      All of the event handling approaches described above respond to the same set\n      of events. The names of the built-in events are listed below. (The hash of\n      built-in events exists in `Ember.EventDispatcher`.) Additional, custom events\n      can be registered by using `Application.customEvents`.\n    \n      Touch events:\n    \n      * `touchStart`\n      * `touchMove`\n      * `touchEnd`\n      * `touchCancel`\n    \n      Keyboard events:\n    \n      * `keyDown`\n      * `keyUp`\n      * `keyPress`\n    \n      Mouse events:\n    \n      * `mouseDown`\n      * `mouseUp`\n      * `contextMenu`\n      * `click`\n      * `doubleClick`\n      * `mouseMove`\n      * `focusIn`\n      * `focusOut`\n      * `mouseEnter`\n      * `mouseLeave`\n    \n      Form events:\n    \n      * `submit`\n      * `change`\n      * `focusIn`\n      * `focusOut`\n      * `input`\n    \n      HTML5 drag and drop events:\n    \n      * `dragStart`\n      * `drag`\n      * `dragEnter`\n      * `dragLeave`\n      * `dragOver`\n      * `dragEnd`\n      * `drop`\n    \n      @class Component\n      @extends Ember.CoreView\n      @uses Ember.TargetActionSupport\n      @uses Ember.ClassNamesSupport\n      @uses Ember.ActionSupport\n      @uses Ember.ViewMixin\n      @uses Ember.ViewStateSupport\n      @public\n    */\n    var Component = _views.CoreView.extend(_views.ChildViewsSupport, _views.ViewStateSupport, _views.ClassNamesSupport, _runtime2.TargetActionSupport, _views.ActionSupport, _views.ViewMixin, (_CoreView$extend = {\n        isComponent: true,\n        init: function () {\n            var _this13 = this;\n\n            this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n            this[IS_DISPATCHING_ATTRS] = false;\n            this[DIRTY_TAG] = _reference.DirtyableTag.create();\n            this[ROOT_REF] = new RootReference(this);\n            this[BOUNDS] = null;\n            // If in a tagless component, assert that no event handlers are defined\n            false && !(this.tagName !== '' || !this.renderer._destinedForDOM || !function () {\n                var eventDispatcher = (0, _owner.getOwner)(_this13).lookup('event_dispatcher:main');\n                var events = eventDispatcher && eventDispatcher._finalEvents || {};\n                // tslint:disable-next-line:forin\n                for (var key in events) {\n                    var methodName = events[key];\n                    if (typeof _this13[methodName] === 'function') {\n                        return true; // indicate that the assertion should be triggered\n                    }\n                }\n                return false;\n            }()) && (0, _debug.assert)(\n            // tslint:disable-next-line:max-line-length\n            'You can not define a function that handles DOM events in the `' + this + '` tagless component since it doesn\\'t have any DOM element.', this.tagName !== '' || !this.renderer._destinedForDOM || !function () {\n                var eventDispatcher = (0, _owner.getOwner)(_this13).lookup('event_dispatcher:main');var events = eventDispatcher && eventDispatcher._finalEvents || {};for (var key in events) {\n                    var methodName = events[key];if (typeof _this13[methodName] === 'function') {\n                        return true;\n                    }\n                }return false;\n            }());\n        },\n        rerender: function () {\n            this[DIRTY_TAG].inner.dirty();\n            this._super();\n        }\n    }, _CoreView$extend[_metal.PROPERTY_DID_CHANGE] = function (key) {\n        if (this[IS_DISPATCHING_ATTRS]) {\n            return;\n        }\n        var args = this[ARGS];\n        var reference = args !== undefined ?

Type into\n      either text area box and they'll both stay in sync. Note that\n      `alias` costs more in terms of performance, so only use it when\n      your really binding in both directions:\n    \n      ```app/controllers/application.js\n      import Controller from '@ember/controller';\n      import { alias } from '@ember/object/computed';\n    \n      export default Controller.extend({\n        writtenWords: \"Lots of text that IS bound\",\n    \n        twoWayWrittenWords: alias(\"writtenWords\")\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{textarea value=writtenWords}}\n      {{textarea value=twoWayWrittenWords}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```html\n      <textarea id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-text-area\">\n        Lots of text that IS bound\n      </textarea>\n      <-- both updated in real time -->\n      <textarea id=\"ember2\" class=\"ember-text-area\">\n        Lots of text that IS bound\n      </textarea>\n      ```\n    \n      ### Actions\n    \n      The helper can send multiple actions based on user events.\n      The action property defines the action which is send when\n      the user presses the return key.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{input action=\"submit\"}}\n      ```\n    \n      The helper allows some user events to send actions.\n    \n      * `enter`\n      * `insert-newline`\n      * `escape-press`\n      * `focus-in`\n      * `focus-out`\n      * `key-press`\n    \n      For example, if you desire an action to be sent when the input is blurred,\n      you only need to setup the action name to the event name property.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{textarea focus-out=\"alertMessage\"}}\n      ```\n    \n      See more about [Text Support Actions](/api/ember/release/classes/TextArea)\n    \n      ### Extension\n    \n      Internally, `{{textarea}}` creates an instance of `TextArea`, passing\n      arguments from the helper to `TextArea`'s `create` method. You can\n      extend the capabilities of text areas in your application by reopening this\n      class. For example, if you are building a Bootstrap project where `data-*`\n      attributes are used, you can globally add support for a `data-*` attribute\n      on all `{{textarea}}`s' in your app by reopening `TextArea` or\n      `TextSupport` and adding it to the `attributeBindings` concatenated\n      property:\n    \n      ```javascript\n      import TextArea from '@ember/component/text-area';\n    \n      TextArea.reopen({\n        attributeBindings: ['data-error']\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Keep in mind when writing `TextArea` subclasses that `TextArea`\n      itself extends `Component`. Expect isolated component semantics, not\n      legacy 1.x view semantics (like `controller` being present).\n    \n      See more about [Ember components](/api/ember/release/classes/Component)\n    \n      @method textarea\n      @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n      @param {Hash} options\n      @public\n    */\n    /**\n      The internal class used to create textarea element when the `{{textarea}}`\n      helper is used.\n    \n      See [Ember.Templates.helpers.textarea](/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/textarea?anchor=textarea)  for usage details.\n    \n      ## Layout and LayoutName properties\n    \n      Because HTML `textarea` elements do not contain inner HTML the `layout` and\n      `layoutName` properties will not be applied.\n    \n      @class TextArea\n      @extends Component\n      @uses Ember.TextSupport\n      @public\n    */\n    var TextArea = Component.extend(_views.TextSupport, {\n        classNames: ['ember-text-area'],\n        layout: layout,\n        tagName: 'textarea',\n        attributeBindings: ['rows', 'cols', 'name', 'selectionEnd', 'selectionStart', 'autocomplete', 'wrap', 'lang', 'dir', 'value'],\n        rows: null,\n        cols: null\n    });\n    TextArea.toString = function () {\n        return '@ember/component/text-area';\n    };\n\n    var layout$1 = template({ \"id\": \"r9g6x1y/\", \"block\": \"{\\\"symbols\\\":[\\\"&default\\\"],\\\"statements\\\":[[4,\\\"if\\\",[[23,[\\\"linkTitle\\\"]]],null,{\\\"statements\\\":[[1,[21,\\\"linkTitle\\\"],false]],\\\"parameters\\\":[]},{\\\"statements\\\":[[14,1]],\\\"parameters\\\":[]}]],\\\"hasEval\\\":false}\", \"meta\": { \"moduleName\": \"packages/@ember/-internals/glimmer/lib/templates/link-to.hbs\" } });\n\n    /**\n    @module ember\n    */\n    /**\n      @module @ember/routing\n    */\n    /**\n      `LinkComponent` renders an element whose `click` event triggers a\n      transition of the application's instance of `Router` to\n      a supplied route by name.\n    \n      `LinkComponent` components are invoked with {{#link-to}}.

It is an extension\n      of the base Handlebars `{{#each}}` helper.\n      The default behavior of `{{#each}}` is to yield its inner block once for every\n      item in an array passing the item as the first block parameter.\n    \n      ```javascript\n      var developers = [{ name: 'Yehuda' },{ name: 'Tom' }, { name: 'Paul' }];\n      ```\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#each developers key=\"name\" as |person|}}\n        {{person.name}}\n        {{! `this` is whatever it was outside the #each }}\n      {{/each}}\n      ```\n    \n      The same rules apply to arrays of primitives.\n    \n      ```javascript\n      var developerNames = ['Yehuda', 'Tom', 'Paul']\n      ```\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#each developerNames key=\"@index\" as |name|}}\n        {{name}}\n      {{/each}}\n      ```\n    \n      During iteration, the index of each item in the array is provided as a second block parameter.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <ul>\n        {{#each people as |person index|}}\n          <li>Hello, {{person.name}}! You're number {{index}} in line</li>\n        {{/each}}\n      </ul>\n      ```\n    \n      ### Specifying Keys\n    \n      The `key` option is used to tell Ember how to determine if the array being\n      iterated over with `{{#each}}` has changed between renders. By helping Ember\n      detect that some elements in the array are the same, DOM elements can be\n      re-used, significantly improving rendering speed.\n    \n      For example, here's the `{{#each}}` helper with its `key` set to `id`:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#each model key=\"id\" as |item|}}\n      {{/each}}\n      ```\n    \n      When this `{{#each}}` re-renders, Ember will match up the previously rendered\n      items (and reorder the generated DOM elements) based on each item's `id`\n      property.\n      By default the item's own reference is used.\n    \n      ### {{else}} condition\n    \n      `{{#each}}` can have a matching `{{else}}`. The contents of this block will render\n      if the collection is empty.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#each developers as |person|}}\n        {{person.name}}\n      {{else}}\n        <p>Sorry, nobody is available for this task.</p>\n      {{/each}}\n      ```\n    \n      @method each\n      @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n      @public\n     */\n    /**\n      The `{{each-in}}` helper loops

@module ember\n    */\n    /**\n      The `{{action}}` helper provides a way to pass triggers for behavior (usually\n      just a function) between components, and into components from controllers.\n    \n      ### Passing functions with the action helper\n    \n      There are three contexts an action helper can be used in. The first two\n      contexts to discuss are attribute context, and Handlebars value context.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{! An example of attribute context }}\n      <div onclick={{action \"save\"}}></div>\n      {{! Examples of Handlebars value context }}\n      {{input on-input=(action \"save\")}}\n      {{yield (action \"refreshData\") andAnotherParam}}\n      ```\n    \n      In these contexts,\n      the helper is called a \"closure action\" helper. Its behavior is simple:\n      If passed a function name, read that function off the `actions` property\n      of the current context. Once that function is read, or immediately if a function was\n      passed, create a closure over that function and any arguments.\n      The resulting value of an action helper used this way is simply a function.\n    \n      For example, in the attribute context:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{! An example of attribute context }}\n      <div onclick={{action \"save\"}}></div>\n      ```\n    \n      The resulting template render logic would be:\n    \n      ```js\n      var div = document.createElement('div');\n      var actionFunction = (function(context){\n        return function() {\n          return context.actions.save.apply(context, arguments);\n        };\n      })(context);\n      div.onclick = actionFunction;\n      ```\n    \n      Thus when the div is clicked, the action on that context is called.\n      Because the `actionFunction` is just a function, closure actions can be\n      passed between components and still execute in the correct context.\n    \n      Here is an example action handler on a component:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-component.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        actions: {\n          save() {\n            this.get('model').save();\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Actions are always looked up on the `actions` property of the current context.\n      This avoids collisions in the naming of common actions, such as `destroy`.\n      Two options can be passed to the `action` helper when it is used in this way.\n    \n      * `target=someProperty` will look to `someProperty` instead of the current\n        context for the `actions` hash. This can be useful when targeting a\n        service for actions.\n      * `value=\"target.value\"` will read the path `target.value` off the first\n        argument to the action when it is called and rewrite the first argument\n        to be that value. This is useful when attaching actions to event listeners.\n    \n      ### Invoking an action\n    \n      Closure actions curry both their scope and any arguments. When invoked, any\n      additional arguments are added to the already curried list.\n      Actions should be invoked using the [sendAction](/api/ember/release/classes/Component/methods/sendAction?anchor=sendAction)\n      method. The first argument to `sendAction` is the action to be called, and\n      additional arguments are passed to the action function. This has interesting\n      properties combined with currying of arguments. For example:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-component.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        actions: {\n          // Usage {{input on-input=(action (action 'setName' model) value=\"target.value\")}}\n          setName(model, name) {\n            model.set('name', name);\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      The first argument (`model`) was curried over, and the run-time argument (`event`)\n      becomes a second argument. Action calls can be nested this way because each simply\n      returns a function. Any function can be passed to the `{{action}}` helper, including\n      other actions.\n    \n      Actions invoked with `sendAction` have the same currying behavior as demonstrated\n      with `on-input` above. For example:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-input.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        actions: {\n          setName(model, name) {\n            model.set('name', name);\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{my-input submit=(action 'setName' model)}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/components/my-component.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        click() {\n          // Note that model is not passed, it was curried in the template\n          this.sendAction('submit', 'bob');\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ### Attaching actions to DOM elements\n    \n      The third context of the `{{action}}` helper can be called \"element space\".\n      For example:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{! An example of element space }}\n      <div {{action \"save\"}}></div>\n      ```\n    \n      Used this way, the `{{action}}` helper provides a useful shortcut for\n      registering an HTML element in a template for a single DOM event and\n      forwarding that interaction to the template's context (controller or component).\n      If the context of a template is a controller, actions used this way will\n      bubble to routes when the controller does not implement the specified action.\n      Once an action hits a route, it will bubble through the route hierarchy.\n    \n      ### Event Propagation\n    \n      `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can control event bubbling. Note\n      that the closure style actions cannot.\n    \n      Events triggered through the action helper will automatically have\n      `.preventDefault()` called on them. You do not need to do so in your event\n      handlers. If you need to allow event propagation (to handle file inputs for\n      example) you can supply the `preventDefault=false` option to the `{{action}}` helper:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <div {{action \"sayHello\" preventDefault=false}}>\n        <input type=\"file\" />\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" />\n      </div>\n      ```\n    \n      To disable bubbling, pass `bubbles=false` to the helper:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <button {{action 'edit' post bubbles=false}}>Edit</button>\n      ```\n    \n      To disable bubbling with closure style actions you must create your own\n      wrapper helper that makes use of `event.stopPropagation()`:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <div onclick={{disable-bubbling (action \"sayHello\")}}>Hello</div>\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/helpers/disable-bubbling.js\n      import { helper } from '@ember/component/helper';\n    \n      export function disableBubbling([action]) {\n        return function(event) {\n          event.stopPropagation();\n          return action(event);\n        };\n      }\n      export default helper(disableBubbling);\n      ```\n    \n      If you need the default handler to trigger you should either register your\n      own event handler, or use event methods on your view class. See\n      [\"Responding to Browser Events\"](/api/ember/release/classes/Component)\n      in the documentation for `Component` for more information.\n    \n      ### Specifying DOM event type\n    \n      `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify an event type.\n      By default the `{{action}}` helper registers for DOM `click` events. You can\n      supply an `on` option to the helper to specify a different DOM event name:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <div {{action \"anActionName\" on=\"doubleClick\"}}>\n        click me\n      </div>\n      ```\n    \n      See [\"Event Names\"](/api/ember/release/classes/Component) for a list of\n      acceptable DOM event names.\n    \n      ### Specifying whitelisted modifier keys\n    \n      `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify modifier keys.\n      By default the `{{action}}` helper will ignore click events with pressed modifier\n      keys. You can supply an `allowedKeys` option to specify which keys should not be ignored.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"alt\"}}>\n        click me\n      </div>\n      ```\n    \n      This way the action will fire when clicking with the alt key pressed down.\n      Alternatively, supply \"any\" to the `allowedKeys` option to accept any combination of modifier keys.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"any\"}}>\n        click me with any key pressed\n      </div>\n      ```\n    \n      ### Specifying a Target\n    \n      A `target` option can be provided to the helper to change\n      which object will receive the method call. This option must be a path\n      to an object, accessible in the current context:\n    \n      ```app/templates/application.hbs\n      <div {{action \"anActionName\" target=someService}}>\n        click me\n      </div>\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/controllers/application.js\n      import Controller from '@ember/controller';\n      import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';\n    \n      export default Controller.extend({\n        someService: service()\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      @method action\n      @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n      @public\n    */\n    function action(_vm, args) {\n        var named = args.named,\n            positional = args.positional;\n\n        var capturedArgs = positional.capture();\n        // The first two argument slots are reserved.\n        // pos[0] is the context (or `this`)\n        // pos[1] is the action name or function\n        // Anything else is an action argument.\n\n        var _capturedArgs$referen = capturedArgs.references,\n            context = _capturedArgs$referen[0],\n            action = _capturedArgs$referen[1],\n            restArgs = _capturedArgs$referen.slice(2);\n        // TODO: Is there a better way of doing this?\n\n\n        var debugKey = action._propertyKey;\n        var target = named.has('target') ? named.get('target') : context;\n        var processArgs = makeArgsProcessor(named.has('value') && named.get('value'), restArgs);\n        var fn = void 0;\n        if (typeof action[INVOKE] === 'function') {\n            fn = makeClosureAction(action, action, action[INVOKE], processArgs, debugKey);\n        } else if ((0, _reference.isConst)(target) && (0, _reference.isConst)(action)) {\n            fn = makeClosureAction(context.value(), target.value(), action.value(), processArgs, debugKey);\n        } else {\n            fn = makeDynamicClosureAction(context.value(), target, action, processArgs, debugKey);\n        }\n        fn[ACTION] = true;\n        return new UnboundReference(fn);\n    }\n    function NOOP$1(args) {\n        return args;\n    }\n    function makeArgsProcessor(valuePathRef, actionArgsRef) {\n        var mergeArgs = void 0;\n        if (actionArgsRef.length > 0) {\n            mergeArgs = function (args) {\n                return actionArgsRef.map(function (ref) {\n                    return ref.value();\n                }).concat(args);\n            };\n        }\n        var readValue = void 0;\n        if (valuePathRef) {\n            readValue = function (args) {\n                var valuePath = valuePathRef.value();\n                if (valuePath && args.length > 0) {\n                    args[0] = (0, _metal.get)(args[0], valuePath);\n                }\n                return args;\n            };\n        }\n        if (mergeArgs && readValue) {\n            return function (args) {\n                return readValue(mergeArgs(args));\n            };\n        } else {\n            return mergeArgs || readValue || NOOP$1;\n        }\n    }\n    function makeDynamicClosureAction(context, targetRef, actionRef, processArgs, debugKey) {\n        // We don't allow undefined/null values, so this creates a throw-away action to trigger the assertions\n        if (false /* DEBUG */) {\n                makeClosureAction(context, targetRef.value(), actionRef.value(), processArgs, debugKey);\n            }\n        return function () {\n            return makeClosureAction(context, targetRef.value(), actionRef.value(), processArgs, debugKey).apply(undefined, arguments);\n        };\n    }\n    function makeClosureAction(context, target, action, processArgs, debugKey) {\n        var self = void 0;\n        var fn = void 0;\n        false && !(action !== undefined && action !== null) && (0, _debug.assert)('Action passed is null or undefined in (action) from ' + target + '.', action !== undefined && action !== null);\n\n        if (typeof action[INVOKE] === 'function') {\n            self = action;\n            fn = action[INVOKE];\n        } else {\n            var typeofAction = typeof action;\n            if (typeofAction === 'string') {\n                self = target;\n                fn = target.actions && target.actions[action];\n                false && !fn && (0, _debug.assert)('An action named \\'' + action + '\\' was not found in ' + target, fn);\n            } else if (typeofAction === 'function') {\n                self = context;\n                fn = action;\n            } else {\n                // tslint:disable-next-line:max-line-length\n                false && !false && (0, _debug.assert)('An action could not be made for `' + (debugKey || action) + '` in ' + target + '.

change the value in the outer context.\n    \n      To specify that a binding is read-only, when invoking the child `Component`:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-parent.js\n      export default Component.extend({\n        totalClicks: 3\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n      {{log totalClicks}} // -> 3\n      {{my-child childClickCount=(readonly

this.incrementProperty('childClickCount');\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      The value updates in the child component, but not the parent component:\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/my-child.hbs\n      {{log childClickCount}} //-> 4\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n      {{log totalClicks}} //-> 3\n      {{my-child childClickCount=(readonly totalClicks)}}\n      ```\n    \n      ### Objects and Arrays\n    \n      When passing a property that is a complex object (e.g. object, array) instead of a primitive object (e.g. number, string),\n      only the reference to the object is protected using the readonly helper.\n      This means that you can change properties of the object both on the parent component, as well as the child component.\n      The `readonly` binding behaves similar to the `const` keyword in JavaScript.\n    \n      Let's look at an example:\n    \n      First let's set up the parent component:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-parent.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        clicks: null,\n    \n        init() {\n          this._super(...arguments);\n          this.set('clicks', { total: 3 });\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n      {{log clicks.total}} //-> 3\n      {{my-child childClicks=(readonly clicks)}}\n      ```\n    \n      Now, if you update the `total` property of `childClicks`:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-child.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        click() {\n          this.get('clicks').incrementProperty('total');\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      You will see the following happen:\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n      {{log clicks.total}} //-> 4\n      {{my-child childClicks=(readonly clicks)}}\n      ```\n    \n

For more info,\n      see the [TextField](/api/ember/release/classes/TextField) docs and\n      the [templates guide](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/templates/input-helpers/).\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{input value=\"987\"}}\n      ```\n    \n      renders as:\n    \n      ```HTML\n      <input type=\"text\" value=\"987\" />\n      ```\n    \n      ### Text field\n    \n      If no `type` option is specified, a default of type 'text' is used.\n      Many of the standard HTML attributes may be passed to this helper.\n      <table>\n        <tr><td>`readonly`</td><td>`required`</td><td>`autofocus`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`value`</td><td>`placeholder`</td><td>`disabled`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`size`</td><td>`tabindex`</td><td>`maxlength`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`name`</td><td>`min`</td><td>`max`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`pattern`</td><td>`accept`</td><td>`autocomplete`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`autosave`</td><td>`formaction`</td><td>`formenctype`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`formmethod`</td><td>`formnovalidate`</td><td>`formtarget`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`height`</td><td>`inputmode`</td><td>`multiple`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`step`</td><td>`width`</td><td>`form`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`selectionDirection`</td><td>`spellcheck`</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n      </table>\n      When set to a quoted string, these values will be directly applied to the HTML\n      element. When left unquoted, these values will be bound to a property on the\n      template's current rendering context (most typically a controller instance).\n      A very common use of this helper is to bind the `value` of an input to an Object's attribute:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      Search:\n      {{input value=searchWord}}\n      ```\n    \n      In this example, the initial value in the `<input />` will be set to the value of `searchWord`.\n      If the user changes the text, the value of `searchWord` will also be updated.\n    \n      ### Actions\n    \n      The helper can send multiple actions based on user events.\n      The action property defines the action which is sent when\n      the user presses the return key.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{input action=\"submit\"}}\n      ```\n    \n      The helper allows some user events to send actions.\n    \n      * `enter`\n      * `insert-newline`\n      * `escape-press`\n      * `focus-in`\n      * `focus-out`\n      * `key-press`\n      * `key-up`\n    \n      For example, if you desire an action to be sent when the input is blurred,\n      you only need to setup the action name to the event name property.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{input focus-out=\"alertMessage\"}}\n      ```\n      See more about [Text Support Actions](/api/ember/release/classes/TextField)\n    \n      ### Extending `TextField`\n    \n      Internally, `{{input type=\"text\"}}` creates an instance of `TextField`, passing\n      arguments from the helper to `TextField`'s `create` method. You can extend the\n      capabilities of text inputs in your applications by reopening this class. For example,\n      if you are building a Bootstrap project where `data-*` attributes are used, you\n      can add one to the `TextField`'s `attributeBindings` property:\n    \n      ```javascript\n      import TextField from '@ember/component/text-field';\n      TextField.reopen({\n        attributeBindings: ['data-error']\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Keep in mind when writing `TextField` subclasses that `TextField`\n      itself extends `Component`. Expect isolated component semantics, not\n      legacy 1.x view semantics (like `controller` being present).\n      See more about [Ember components](/api/ember/release/classes/Component)\n    \n      ### Checkbox\n    \n      Checkboxes are special forms of the `{{input}}` helper.  To create a `<checkbox />`:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      Emberize Everything:\n      {{input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"isEmberized\" checked=isEmberized}}\n      ```\n    \n      This will bind checked state of this checkbox to the value of `isEmberized`  -- if either one changes,\n      it will be reflected in the other.\n    \n      The following HTML attributes can be set via the helper:\n    \n      * `checked`\n      * `disabled`\n      * `tabindex`\n      * `indeterminate`\n      * `name`\n      * `autofocus`\n      * `form`\n    \n      ### Extending `Checkbox`\n    \n      Internally, `{{input type=\"checkbox\"}}` creates an instance of `Checkbox`, passing\n      arguments from the helper to `Checkbox`'s `create` method. You can extend the\n      capablilties of checkbox inputs in your applications by reopening this class. For example,\n      if you wanted to add a css class to all checkboxes in your application:\n    \n      ```javascript\n      import Checkbox from '@ember/component/checkbox';\n    \n      Checkbox.reopen({\n        classNames: ['my-app-checkbox']\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      @method input\n      @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n      @param {Hash} options\n      @public\n    */\n

[Glimmer](https://github.com/tildeio/glimmer) is a templating engine used by Ember.js that is compatible with a subset of the [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) syntax.\n    \n      ### Showing a property\n    \n      Templates manage the flow of an application's UI, and display state (through\n      the DOM) to a user. For example, given a component with the property \"name\",\n      that component's template can use the name in several ways:\n    \n      ```app/components/person-profile.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        name: 'Jill'\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n      {{name}}\n      <div>{{name}}</div>\n      <span data-name={{name}}></span>\n      ```\n    \n      Any time the \"name\" property on the component changes, the DOM will be\n      updated.\n    \n      Properties can be chained as well:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{aUserModel.name}}\n      <div>{{listOfUsers.firstObject.name}}</div>\n      ```\n    \n      ### Using Ember helpers\n    \n      When content is passed in mustaches `{{}}`, Ember will first try to find a helper\n      or component with that name. For example, the `if` helper:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{if name \"I have a name\" \"I have no name\"}}\n      <span data-has-name={{if name true}}></span>\n      ```\n    \n      The returned value is placed where the `{{}}` is called. The above style is\n      called \"inline\". A second style of helper usage is called \"block\". For example:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#if name}}\n      I have a name\n      {{else}}\n      I have no name\n      {{/if}}\n      ```\n    \n      The block form of helpers allows you to control how the UI is created based\n      on the values of properties.\n      A third form of helper is called \"nested\". For example here the concat\n      helper will add \" Doe\" to a displayed name if the person has no last name:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <span data-name={{concat firstName (\n      if lastName (concat \" \" lastName) \"Doe\"\n      )}}></span>\n      ```\n    \n      Ember's built-in helpers are described under the [Ember.Templates.helpers](/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers)\n      namespace. Documentation on creating custom helpers can be found under\n      [Helper](/api/classes/Ember.Helper.html).\n    \n      ### Invoking a Component\n    \n      Ember components represent state to the UI of an application. Further\n      reading on components can be found under [Component](/api/ember/release/classes/Component).\n    \n      @module @ember/component\n      @main @ember/component\n      @public\n

You can specify various properties\n      that your computed property depends on. This will force the cached\n      result to be recomputed if the dependencies are modified.\n    \n      In the following example we declare a computed property - `fullName` - by calling\n      `computed` with property dependencies (`firstName` and `lastName`) as leading arguments and getter accessor function. The `fullName` getter function\n      will be called once (regardless of how many times it is accessed) as long\n      as its dependencies have not changed. Once `firstName` or `lastName` are updated\n      any future calls (or anything bound) to `fullName` will incorporate the new\n      values.\n    \n      ```javascript\n      import EmberObject, { computed } from '@ember/object';\n    \n      let Person = EmberObject.extend({\n        // these will be supplied by `create`\n        firstName: null,\n        lastName: null,\n    \n        fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {\n          let firstName = this.get('firstName'),\n              lastName  = this.get('lastName');\n    \n          return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;\n        })\n      });\n    \n      let tom = Person.create({\n        firstName: 'Tom',\n        lastName: 'Dale'\n      });\n    \n      tom.get('fullName') // 'Tom Dale'\n      ```\n    \n      You can also define what Ember should do when setting a computed property by providing additional function (`set`) in hash argument.\n      If you try to set a computed property, it will try to invoke setter accessor function with the key and\n      value you want to set it to as arguments.\n    \n      ```javascript\n      import EmberObject, { computed } from '@ember/object';\n    \n      let Person = EmberObject.extend({\n        // these will be supplied by `create`\n        firstName: null,\n        lastName: null,\n    \n        fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', {\n          get(key) {\n            let firstName = this.get('firstName'),\n                lastName  = this.get('lastName');\n    \n            return firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n          },\n          set(key, value) {\n            let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');\n    \n            this.set('firstName', firstName);\n            this.set('lastName', lastName);\n    \n            return value;\n          }\n        })\n      });\n    \n      let person = Person.create();\n    \n      person.set('fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');\n      person.get('firstName'); // 'Peter'\n      person.get('lastName');  // 'Wagenet'\n      ```\n    \n      You can overwrite computed property with normal property (no longer computed), that won't change if dependencies change, if you set computed property and it won't have setter accessor function defined.\n    \n      You can also mark computed property as `.readOnly()` and block all attempts to set it.\n    \n      ```javascript\n      import EmberObject, { computed } from '@ember/object';\n    \n      let Person = EmberObject.extend({\n        // these will be supplied by `create`\n        firstName: null,\n        lastName: null,\n    \n        fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', {\n          get(key) {\n            let firstName = this.get('firstName');\n            let lastName  = this.get('lastName');\n    \n            return firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n          }\n        }).readOnly()\n      });\n    \n      let person = Person.create();\n      person.set('fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');

For\n        example, in the above example, the `fullName` property depends on\n        `firstName` and `lastName` to determine its value. You can tell Ember\n        about these dependencies like this:\n         ```app/utils/president.js\n        import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n         export default EmberObject.extend({\n          firstName: '',\n          lastName:  '',\n           fullName: function() {\n            return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');\n             // Tell Ember.js that this computed property depends on firstName\n            // and lastName\n          }.property('firstName', 'lastName')\n        });\n        ```\n         Make sure you list these dependencies so Ember knows when to update\n        bindings that connect to a computed property. Changing a dependency\n        will not immediately trigger an update of the computed property, but\n        will instead clear the cache so that it is updated when the next `get`\n        is called on the property.\n         See [ComputedProperty](/api/ember/release/classes/ComputedProperty), [@ember/object/computed](/api/ember/release/classes/@ember%2Fobject%2Fcomputed).\n         @method property\n        @for Function\n        @public\n      */\n      property: {\n        configurable: true,\n        enumerable: false,\n        writable: true,\n        value: function () {\n          return _metal.computed.apply(undefined, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).concat([this]));\n        }\n      },\n\n      /**\n        The `observes` extension of Javascript's Function prototype is available\n        when `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES` or `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES.Function` is\n        true, which is the default.\n         You can observe property changes simply by adding the `observes`\n        call to the end of your method declarations in classes that you write.\n        For example:\n         ```javascript\n        import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n         EmberObject.extend({\n          valueObserver: function() {\n            // Executes whenever the \"value\" property changes\n          }.observes('value')\n        });\n        ```\n         In the future this method may become asynchronous.\n         See `observer`.\n         @method observes\n        @for Function\n        @public\n      */\n      observes: {\n        configurable: true,\n        enumerable: false,\n        writable: true,\n        value: function () {\n          return _metal.observer.apply(undefined, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).concat([this]));\n        }\n      },\n\n      /**\n        The `on` extension of Javascript's Function prototype is available\n        when `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES` or `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES.Function` is\n        true, which is the default.\n         You can listen for events simply by adding the `on` call to the end of\n        your method declarations in classes or mixins that you write.

// ...\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/welcome.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n      import CanDisplayBanner from '../mixins/can-display-banner';\n       export default Route.extend(CanDisplayBanner, {\n        actions: {\n          playMusic() {\n            // ...\n          }\n        }\n      });\n       // `WelcomeRoute`, when active, will be able to respond\n      // to both actions, since the actions hash is merged rather\n      // then replaced when extending mixins / parent classes.\n      this.send('displayBanner');\n      this.send('playMusic');\n      ```\n       Within a Controller, Route or Component's action handler,\n      the value of the `this` context is the Controller, Route or\n      Component object:\n       ```app/routes/song.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          myAction() {\n            this.controllerFor(\"song\");\n            this.transitionTo(\"other.route\");\n            ...\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       It is also possible to call `this._super(...arguments)` from within an\n      action handler if it overrides a handler defined on a parent\n      class or mixin:\n       Take for example the following routes:\n       ```app/mixins/debug-route.js\n      import Mixin from '@ember/mixin';\n       export default Mixin.create({\n        actions: {\n          debugRouteInformation() {\n            console.debug(\"It's a-me, console.debug!\");\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/annoying-debug.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n      import DebugRoute from '../mixins/debug-route';\n       export default Route.extend(DebugRoute, {\n        actions: {\n          debugRouteInformation() {\n            // also call the debugRouteInformation of mixed in DebugRoute\n            this._super(...arguments);\n             // show additional annoyance\n            window.alert(...);\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ## Bubbling\n       By default, an action will stop bubbling once a handler defined\n      on the `actions` hash handles it. To continue bubbling the action,\n      you must return `true` from the handler:\n       ```app/router.js\n      Router.map(function() {\n        this.route(\"album\", function() {\n          this.route(\"song\");\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/album.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          startPlaying: function() {\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/album-song.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          startPlaying() {\n            // ...\n             if (actionShouldAlsoBeTriggeredOnParentRoute) {\n              return true;\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       @property actions\n      @type Object\n      @default null\n      @public\n    */\n\n    /**\n      Triggers a named action on the `ActionHandler`. Any parameters\n      supplied after the `actionName` string will be passed as arguments\n      to the action target function.\n       If the `ActionHandler` has its `target` property set, actions may\n      bubble to the `target`. Bubbling happens when an `actionName` can\n      not be found in the `ActionHandler`'s `actions` hash or if the\n      action target function returns `true`.\n       Example\n       ```app/routes/welcome.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          playTheme() {\n            this.send('playMusic', 'theme.mp3');\n          },\n          playMusic(track) {\n            // ...\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       @method send\n      @param {String} actionName The action to trigger\n      @param {*} context a context to send with the action\n      @public\n    */\n    send: function (actionName) {\n      for (var _len = arguments.length, args = Array(_len > 1 ?

Both of these classes use\n    the Array Mixin by way of the MutableArray mixin, which allows observable\n    changes to be made to the underlying array.\n  \n    This mixin defines methods specifically for collections that provide\n    index-ordered access to their contents. When you are designing code that\n    needs to accept any kind of Array-like object, you should use these methods\n    instead of Array primitives because these will properly notify observers of\n    changes to the array.\n  \n    Although these methods are efficient, they do add a layer of indirection to\n    your application so it is a good idea to use them only when you need the\n    flexibility of using both true JavaScript arrays and \"virtual\" arrays such\n    as controllers and collections.\n  \n    You can use the methods defined in this module to access and modify array\n    contents in a KVO-friendly way. You can also be notified whenever the\n    membership of an array changes by using `.observes('myArray.[]')`.\n  \n    To support `EmberArray` in your own class, you must override two\n    primitives to use it: `length()` and `objectAt()`.\n  \n    @class EmberArray\n    @uses Enumerable\n    @since Ember 0.9.0\n    @public\n  */\n  var ArrayMixin = _metal.Mixin.create(_enumerable.default, (_Mixin$create = {}, _Mixin$create[EMBER_ARRAY] = true, _Mixin$create.objectsAt = function (indexes) {\n    var _this = this;\n\n    return indexes.map(function (idx) {\n      return (0, _metal.objectAt)(_this, idx);\n    });\n  }, _Mixin$create['[]'] = (0, _metal.computed)({\n    get: function () {\n      return this;\n    },\n    set: function (key, value) {\n      this.replace(0, this.length, value);\n      return this;\n    }\n  }), _Mixin$create.firstObject = (0, _metal.computed)(function () {\n    return (0, _metal.objectAt)(this, 0);\n  }).readOnly(), _Mixin$create.lastObject = (0, _metal.computed)(function () {\n    return (0, _metal.objectAt)(this, this.length - 1);\n  }).readOnly(), _Mixin$create.slice = function () {\n    var beginIndex = arguments.length > 0 && arguments[0] !== undefined ?

This is useful for those times when you need to\n      implement a property that is composed of one or more member\n      properties.\n       ### Unknown Properties\n       If you try to set a value on a key that is undefined in the target\n      object, then the `setUnknownProperty()` handler will be called instead.

For example, `controller:post` looks up\n      `App.PostController` by default.\n    * there are some nuances (see examples below)\n  \n    ### How Resolving Works\n  \n    The container calls this object's `resolve` method with the\n    `fullName` argument.\n  \n    It first parses the fullName into an object using `parseName`.\n  \n    Then it checks for the presence of a type-specific instance\n    method of the form `resolve[Type]` and calls it if it exists.\n    For example if it was resolving 'template:post', it would call\n    the `resolveTemplate` method.\n  \n    Its last resort is to call the `resolveOther` method.\n  \n    The methods of this object are designed to be easy to override\n    in a subclass. For example, you could enhance how a template\n    is resolved like so:\n  \n    ```app/app.js\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n    import GlobalsResolver from '@ember/application/globals-resolver';\n  \n    App = Application.create({\n      Resolver: GlobalsResolver.extend({\n        resolveTemplate(parsedName) {\n          let resolvedTemplate = this._super(parsedName);\n          if (resolvedTemplate) { return resolvedTemplate; }\n  \n          return Ember.TEMPLATES['not_found'];\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Some examples of how names are resolved:\n  \n    ```text\n    'template:post'           //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['post']\n    'template:posts/byline'   //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['posts/byline']\n    'template:posts.byline'   //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['posts/byline']\n    'template:blogPost'       //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['blog-post']\n    'controller:post'         //=> App.PostController\n    'controller:posts.index'  //=> App.PostsIndexController\n    'controller:blog/post'    //=> Blog.PostController\n    'controller:basic'        //=> Controller\n    'route:post'              //=> App.PostRoute\n    'route:posts.index'       //=> App.PostsIndexRoute\n    'route:blog/post'         //=> Blog.PostRoute\n    'route:basic'             //=> Route\n    'foo:post'                //=> App.PostFoo\n    'model:post'              //=> App.Post\n    ```\n  \n    @class GlobalsResolver\n    @extends EmberObject\n    @public\n  */\n\n  var DefaultResolver = function (_EmberObject) {\n    (0, _emberBabel.inherits)(DefaultResolver, _EmberObject);\n\n    function DefaultResolver() {\n\n      return (0, _emberBabel.possibleConstructorReturn)(this, _EmberObject.apply(this, arguments));\n    }\n\n    DefaultResolver.create = function create(props) {\n      // DO NOT REMOVE even though this doesn't do anything\n      // This is required for a FireFox 60+ JIT bug with our tests.\n      // without it, create(props) in our tests would lose props on a deopt.\n      return _EmberObject.create.call(this, props);\n    };\n\n    /**\n      This will be set to the Application instance when it is\n      created.\n       @property namespace\n      @public\n    */\n\n    DefaultResolver.prototype.init = function init() {\n      this._parseNameCache = (0, _utils.dictionary)(null);\n    };\n\n    DefaultResolver.prototype.normalize = function normalize(fullName) {\n      var _fullName$split = fullName.split(':'),\n          type = _fullName$split[0],\n          name = _fullName$split[1];\n\n      false && !(fullName.split(':').length === 2) && (0, _debug.assert)('Tried to normalize a container name without a colon (:) in it.

It helps to instantiate, initialize and coordinate the many\n    objects that make up your app.\n  \n    Each Ember app has one and only one `Application` object. In fact, the\n    very first thing you should do in your application is create the instance:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    window.App = Application.create();\n    ```\n  \n    Typically, the application object is the only global variable. All other\n    classes in your app should be properties on the `Application` instance,\n    which highlights its first role: a global namespace.\n  \n    For example, if you define a view class, it might look like this:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    App.MyView = Ember.View.extend();\n    ```\n  \n    By default, calling `Application.create()` will automatically initialize\n    your application by calling the `Application.initialize()` method. If\n    you need to delay initialization, you can call your app's `deferReadiness()`\n    method. When you are ready for your app to be initialized, call its\n    `advanceReadiness()` method.\n  \n    You can define a `ready` method on the `Application` instance, which\n    will be run by Ember when the application is initialized.\n  \n    Because `Application` inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes\n    you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.\n    See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.\n  \n    While you can think of your `Application` as a container that holds the\n    other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities\n    going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand.\n  \n    ### Event Delegation\n  \n    Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework\n    to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to\n    do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own\n    `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`\n    listener on the `body`.\n  \n    If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and\n    start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking\n    their `mouseDown` method as it goes.\n  \n    `Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as\n    well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For\n    example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be\n    called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.\n  \n    If there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by\n    default, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method\n    names by setting the application's `customEvents` property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      customEvents: {\n        // add support for the paste event\n        paste: 'paste'\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    To prevent Ember from setting up a listener for a default event,\n    specify the event name with a `null` value in the `customEvents`\n    property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      customEvents: {\n        // prevent listeners for mouseenter/mouseleave events\n        mouseenter: null,\n        mouseleave: null\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document\n    body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside\n    an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element\n    inside the body.\n  \n    For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`\n    should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      rootElement: '#ember-app'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a jQuery-compatible selector\n    string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will\n    not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only\n    append views inside it!\n  \n    To learn more about the events Ember components use, see\n  \n    [components/handling-events](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/handling-events/#toc_event-names).\n  \n    ### Initializers\n  \n    Libraries on top of Ember can add initializers, like so:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    Application.initializer({\n      name: 'api-adapter',\n  \n      initialize: function(application) {\n        application.register('api-adapter:main', ApiAdapter);\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Initializers provide an opportunity to access the internal registry, which\n    organizes the different components of an Ember application. Additionally\n    they provide a chance to access the instantiated application. Beyond\n    being used for libraries, initializers are also a great way to organize\n    dependency injection or setup in your own application.\n  \n    ### Routing\n  \n    In addition to creating your application's router, `Application` is\n    also responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions\n    between routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more\n    detailed intra-transition logging can be logged with\n    the `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions\n      LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into\n    application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you\n    need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`\n    method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.\n  \n    If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a\n    `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing\n    begins.\n  \n    @class Application\n    @extends Engine\n    @uses RegistryProxyMixin\n    @public\n  */\n\n  var Application = _engine.default.extend({\n    /**\n      The root DOM element of the Application.

See the documentation on\n      `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.\n       `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` is an interface class that exists\n      purely to document the available options; you do not need to construct it\n      manually. Simply pass a regular JavaScript object containing of the\n      desired options:\n       ```javascript\n      MyApp.visit(\"/\", { location: \"none\", rootElement: \"#container\" });\n      ```\n       ### Supported Scenarios\n       While the `BootOptions` class exposes a large number of knobs, not all\n      combinations of them are valid; certain incompatible combinations might\n      result in unexpected behavior.\n       For example, booting the instance in the full browser environment\n      while specifying a foreign `document` object (e.g. `{ isBrowser: true,\n      document: iframe.contentDocument }`) does not work correctly today,\n      largely due to Ember's jQuery dependency.\n       Currently, there are three officially supported scenarios/configurations.\n      Usages outside of these scenarios are not guaranteed to work, but please\n      feel free to file bug reports documenting your experience and any issues\n      you encountered to help expand support.\n       #### Browser Applications (Manual Boot)\n       The setup is largely similar to how Ember works out-of-the-box. Normally,\n      Ember will boot a default instance for your Application on \"DOM ready\".\n      However, you can customize this behavior by disabling `autoboot`.\n       For example, this allows you to render a miniture demo of your application\n      into a specific area on your marketing website:\n       ```javascript\n      import MyApp from 'my-app';\n       $(function() {\n        let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });\n         let options = {\n          // Override the router's location adapter to prevent it from updating\n          // the URL in the address bar\n          location: 'none',\n           // Override the default `rootElement` on the app to render into a\n          // specific `div` on the page\n          rootElement: '#demo'\n        };\n         // Start the app at the special demo URL\n        App.visit('/demo', options);\n      });\n      ```\n       Or perhaps you might want to boot two instances of your app on the same\n      page for a split-screen multiplayer experience:\n       ```javascript\n      import MyApp from 'my-app';\n       $(function() {\n        let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });\n         let sessionId = MyApp.generateSessionID();\n         let player1 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+1&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#left', location: 'none' });\n        let player2 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+2&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#right', location: 'none' });\n         Promise.all([player1, player2]).then(() => {\n          // Both apps have completed the initial render\n          $('#loading').fadeOut();\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n       Do note that each app instance maintains their own registry/container, so\n      they will run in complete isolation by default.\n       #### Server-Side Rendering (also known as FastBoot)\n       This setup allows you to run your Ember app in a server environment using\n      Node.js and render its content into static HTML for SEO purposes.\n       ```javascript\n      const HTMLSerializer = new SimpleDOM.HTMLSerializer(SimpleDOM.voidMap);\n       function renderURL(url) {\n        let dom = new SimpleDOM.Document();\n        let rootElement = dom.body;\n        let options = { isBrowser: false, document: dom, rootElement: rootElement };\n         return MyApp.visit(options).then(instance => {\n          try {\n            return HTMLSerializer.serialize(rootElement.firstChild);\n          } finally {\n            instance.destroy();\n          }\n        });\n      }\n      ```\n       In this scenario, because Ember does not have access to a global `document`\n      object in the Node.js environment, you must provide one explicitly. In practice,\n      in the non-browser environment, the stand-in `document` object only needs to\n      implement a limited subset of the full DOM API. The `SimpleDOM` library is known\n      to work.\n       Since there is no access to jQuery in the non-browser environment, you must also\n      specify a DOM `Element` object in the same `document` for the `rootElement` option\n      (as opposed to a selector string like `\"body\"`).\n       See the documentation on the `isBrowser`, `document` and `rootElement` properties\n      on `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.\n       #### Server-Side Resource Discovery\n       This setup allows you to run the routing layer of your Ember app in a server\n      environment using Node.js and completely disable rendering. This allows you\n      to simulate and discover the resources (i.e. AJAX requests) needed to fulfill\n      a given request and eagerly \"push\" these resources to the client.\n       ```app/initializers/network-service.js\n      import BrowserNetworkService from 'app/services/network/browser';\n      import NodeNetworkService from 'app/services/network/node';\n       // Inject a (hypothetical) service for abstracting all AJAX calls and use\n      // the appropriate implementation on the client/server. This also allows the\n      // server to log all the AJAX calls made during a particular request and use\n      // that for resource-discovery purpose.\n       export function initialize(application) {\n        if (window) { // browser\n          application.register('service:network', BrowserNetworkService);\n        } else { // node\n          application.register('service:network', NodeNetworkService);\n        }\n         application.inject('route', 'network', 'service:network');\n      };\n       export default {\n        name: 'network-service',\n        initialize: initialize\n      };\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/post.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       // An example of how the (hypothetical) service is used in routes.\n       export default Route.extend({\n        model(params) {\n          return this.network.fetch(`/api/posts/${params.post_id}.json`);\n        },\n         afterModel(post) {\n          if (post.isExternalContent) {\n            return this.network.fetch(`/api/external/?url=${post.externalURL}`);\n          } else {\n            return post;\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```javascript\n      // Finally, put all the pieces together\n       function discoverResourcesFor(url) {\n        return MyApp.visit(url, { isBrowser: false, shouldRender: false }).then(instance => {\n          let networkService = instance.lookup('service:network');\n          return networkService.requests; // => { \"/api/posts/123.json\": \"...\" }\n        });\n      }\n      ```\n       @public\n      @method visit\n      @param url {String} The initial URL to navigate to\n      @param options {ApplicationInstance.BootOptions}\n      @return {Promise<ApplicationInstance, Error>}\n    */\n    visit: function (url, options) {\n      var _this = this;\n\n      return this.boot().then(function () {\n        var instance = _this.buildInstance();\n\n        return instance.boot(options).then(function () {\n          return instance.visit(url);\n        }).catch(function (error) {\n          (0, _runloop.run)(instance, 'destroy');\n          throw error;\n        });\n      });\n    }\n  });\n\n  Application.reopenClass({\n    /**\n      This creates a registry with the default Ember naming conventions.\n       It also configures the registry:\n       * registered views are created every time they are looked up (they are\n        not singletons)\n      * registered templates are not factories;

This is equivalent to calling\n    `later` with a wait time of 1ms.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { next } from '@ember/runloop';\n  \n    next(myContext, function() {\n      // code to be executed in the next run loop,\n      // which will be scheduled after the current one\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Multiple operations scheduled with `next` will coalesce\n    into the same later run loop, along with any other operations\n    scheduled by `later` that expire right around the same\n    time that `next` operations will fire.\n  \n    Note that there are often alternatives to using `next`.\n    For instance, if you'd like to schedule an operation to happen\n    after all DOM element operations have completed within the current\n    run loop, you can make use of the `afterRender` run loop queue (added\n    by the `ember-views` package, along with the preceding `render` queue\n    where all the DOM element operations happen).\n  \n    Example:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-component.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n    import { scheduleOnce } from '@ember/runloop';\n  \n    export Component.extend({\n      didInsertElement() {\n        this._super(...arguments);\n        scheduleOnce('afterRender', this, 'processChildElements');\n      },\n  \n      processChildElements() {\n        // ... do something with component's child component\n        // elements after they've finished rendering, which\n        // can't be done within this component's\n        // `didInsertElement` hook because that gets run\n        // before the child elements have been added to the DOM.\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    One benefit of the above approach compared to using `next` is\n    that you will be able to perform DOM/CSS operations before unprocessed\n    elements are rendered to the screen, which may prevent flickering or\n    other artifacts caused by delaying processing until after rendering.\n  \n    The other major benefit to the above approach is that `next`\n    introduces an element of non-determinism, which can make things much\n    harder to test, due to its reliance on `setTimeout`; it's much harder\n    to guarantee the order of scheduled operations when they are scheduled\n    outside of the current run loop, i.e. with `next`.\n  \n    @method next\n    @static\n    @for @ember/runloop\n    @param {Object} [target] target of method to invoke\n    @param {Function|String} method The method to invoke.\n      If you pass a string it will be resolved on the\n      target at the time the method is invoked.\n    @param {Object} [args*] Optional arguments to pass to the timeout.\n    @return {Object} Timer information for use in canceling, see `cancel`.\n    @public\n  */\n  function next() {\n    for (var _len4 = arguments.length, args = Array(_len4), _key4 = 0; _key4 < _len4; _key4++) {\n      args[_key4] = arguments[_key4];\n    }\n\n    args.push(1);\n    return backburner.later.apply(backburner, args);\n  }\n\n  /**\n    Cancels a scheduled item.

The\n    primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n    registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n    why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n  \n    Terminology\n    -----------\n  \n    - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n    - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n    - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n    - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n    - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n    - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n  \n    A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n  \n    Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n    state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n    rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n  \n    Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n    promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n    settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n    itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n    itself fulfill.\n  \n  \n    Basic Usage:\n    ------------\n  \n    ```js\n    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n      // on success\n      resolve(value);\n  \n      // on failure\n      reject(reason);\n    });\n  \n    promise.then(function(value) {\n      // on fulfillment\n    }, function(reason) {\n      // on rejection\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Advanced Usage:\n    ---------------\n  \n    Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n    `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n  \n    ```js\n    function getJSON(url) {\n      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n        let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  \n        xhr.open('GET', url);\n        xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n        xhr.responseType = 'json';\n        xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n        xhr.send();\n  \n        function handler() {\n          if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n            if (this.status === 200) {\n              resolve(this.response);\n            } else {\n              reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n            }\n          }\n        };\n      });\n    }\n  \n    getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n      // on fulfillment\n    }, function(reason) {\n      // on rejection\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n  \n    ```js\n    Promise.all([\n      getJSON('/posts'),\n      getJSON('/comments')\n    ]).then(function(values){\n      values[0] // => postsJSON\n      values[1] // => commentsJSON\n  \n      return values;\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @class RSVP.Promise\n    @param {function} resolver\n    @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @constructor\n  */\n\n  var Promise = function () {\n    function Promise(resolver, label) {\n\n      this._id = counter++;\n      this._label = label;\n      this._state = undefined;\n      this._result = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      config.instrument && instrument('created', this);\n\n      if (noop !== resolver) {\n        typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n        this instanceof Promise ?

You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the\n    browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,\n    `denodeify` transforms the following:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n  \n    fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n      if (err) return handleError(err);\n      handleData(data);\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    into:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n    let readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n  \n    readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);\n    ```\n  \n    If the node function has multiple success parameters, then `denodeify`\n    just returns the first one:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'));\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(res) {\n      // ...\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    However, if you need all success parameters, setting `denodeify`'s\n    second parameter to `true` causes it to return all success parameters\n    as an array:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), true);\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n      // result[0] -> res\n      // result[1] -> body\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Or if you pass it an array with names it returns the parameters as a hash:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), ['res', 'body']);\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n      // result.res\n      // result.body\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Sometimes you need to retain the `this`:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let app = require('express')();\n    let render = RSVP.denodeify(app.render.bind(app));\n    ```\n  \n    The denodified function inherits from the original function. It works in all\n    environments, except IE 10 and below. Consequently all properties of the original\n    function are available to you. However, any properties you change on the\n    denodeified function won't be changed on the original function. Example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request')),\n        cookieJar = request.jar(); // <- Inheritance is used here\n  \n    request('http://example.com', {jar: cookieJar}).then(function(res) {\n      // cookieJar.cookies holds now the cookies returned by example.com\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead\n    of using callbacks. For example, instead of:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n  \n    fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n      if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n      fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){\n        if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n        console.log('done')\n      });\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    you can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n    let readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n    let writeFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.writeFile);\n  \n    readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){\n      return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);\n    }).then(function(){\n      console.log('done')\n    }).catch(function(error){\n      // Handle error\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method denodeify\n    @static\n    @for RSVP\n    @param {Function} nodeFunc a 'node-style' function that takes a callback as\n    its last argument.

For example,\n    say you want to get all comments from a set of blog posts, but you need\n    the blog posts first because they contain a url to those comments.\n  \n    ```javscript\n  \n    let mapFn = function(blogPost){\n      // getComments does some ajax and returns an RSVP.Promise that is fulfilled\n      // with some comments data\n      return getComments(blogPost.comments_url);\n    };\n  \n    // getBlogPosts does some ajax and returns an RSVP.Promise that is fulfilled\n    // with some blog post data\n    RSVP.map(getBlogPosts(), mapFn).then(function(comments){\n      // comments is the result of asking the server for the comments\n      // of all blog posts returned from getBlogPosts()\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method map\n    @static\n    @for RSVP\n    @param {Array} promises\n    @param {Function} mapFn function to be called on each fulfilled promise.\n    @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @return {Promise} promise that is fulfilled with the result of calling\n    `mapFn` on each fulfilled promise or value when they become fulfilled.\n     The promise will be rejected if any of the given `promises` become rejected.\n    @static\n  */\n\n  function map(promises, mapFn, label) {\n    if (!Array.isArray(promises)) {\n      return Promise.reject(new TypeError(\"RSVP.map must be called with an array\"), label);\n    }\n\n    if (typeof mapFn !== 'function') {\n      return Promise.reject(new TypeError(\"RSVP.map expects a function as a second argument\"), label);\n    }\n\n    return new MapEnumerator(Promise, promises, mapFn, label).promise;\n  }\n\n  /**\n    This is a convenient alias for `RSVP.Promise.resolve`.\n  \n    @method resolve\n    @static\n    @for RSVP\n    @param {*} value value that the returned promise will be resolved with\n    @param {String} label optional string for identifying the returned promise.\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @return {Promise} a promise that will become fulfilled with the given\n    `value`\n  */\n  function resolve$2(value, label) {\n    return Promise.resolve(value, label);\n  }\n\n  /**\n    This is a convenient alias for `RSVP.Promise.reject`.\n  \n    @method reject\n    @static\n    @for RSVP\n    @param {*} reason value that the returned promise will be rejected with.\n    @param {String} label optional string for identifying the returned promise.\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @return {Promise} a promise rejected with the given `reason`.\n  */\n  function reject$2(reason, label) {\n    return Promise.reject(reason, label);\n  }\n\n  var EMPTY_OBJECT = {};\n\n  var FilterEnumerator = function (_MapEnumerator) {\n    (0, _emberBabel.inherits)(FilterEnumerator, _MapEnumerator);\n\n    function FilterEnumerator() {\n\n      return (0, _emberBabel.possibleConstructorReturn)(this, _MapEnumerator.apply(this, arguments));\n    }\n\n    FilterEnumerator.prototype._checkFullfillment = function _checkFullfillment() {\n      if (this._remaining === 0 && this._result !== null) {\n        var result = this._result.filter(function (val) {\n          return val !== EMPTY_OBJECT;\n        });\n        fulfill(this.promise, result);\n        this._result = null;\n      }\n    };\n\n    FilterEnumerator.prototype._setResultAt = function _setResultAt(state, i, value, firstPass) {\n      if (firstPass) {\n        this._result[i] = value;\n        var val = tryCatch(this._mapFn)(value, i);\n        if (val === TRY_CATCH_ERROR) {\n          this._settledAt(REJECTED, i, val.error, false);\n        } else {\n          this._eachEntry(val, i, false);\n        }\n      } else {\n        this._remaining--;\n        if (!value) {\n          this._result[i] = EMPTY_OBJECT;\n        }\n      }\n    };\n\n    return FilterEnumerator;\n  }(MapEnumerator);\n\n  /**\n   `RSVP.filter` is similar to JavaScript's native `filter` method.\n   `filterFn` is eagerly called meaning that as soon as any promise\n    resolves its value will be passed to `filterFn`. `RSVP.filter` returns\n    a promise that will become fulfilled with the result of running\n    `filterFn` on the values the promises become fulfilled with.\n  \n    For example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n  \n    let promise1 = RSVP.resolve(1);\n    let promise2 = RSVP.resolve(2);\n    let promise3 = RSVP.resolve(3);\n  \n    let promises = [promise1, promise2, promise3];\n  \n    let filterFn = function(item){\n      return item > 1;\n    };\n  \n    RSVP.filter(promises, filterFn).then(function(result){\n      // result is [ 2, 3 ]\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    If any of the `promises` given to `RSVP.filter` are rejected, the first promise\n    that is rejected will be given as an argument to the returned promise's\n    rejection handler.

Each\n    error object is a JavaScript object with two keys:\n\n    - `message` A string containing the error message from the backend\n    - `attribute` The name of the property associated with this error message\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <label>Username: {{input value=username}} </label>\n    {{#each model.errors.username as |error|}}\n      <div class=\"error\">\n        {{error.message}}\n      </div>\n    {{/each}}\n\n    <label>Email: {{input value=email}} </label>\n    {{#each model.errors.email as |error|}}\n      <div class=\"error\">\n        {{error.message}}\n      </div>\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n\n    You can also access the special `messages` property on the error\n    object to get an array of all the error strings.\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each model.errors.messages as |message|}}\n      <div class=\"error\">\n        {{message}}\n      </div>\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n\n    @class Errors\n    @namespace DS\n    @extends Ember.Object\n    @uses Ember.Enumerable\n    @uses Ember.Evented\n   */\n  var Errors = Ember.ArrayProxy.extend(Ember.Evented, {\n    /**\n      Register with target handler\n       @method _registerHandlers\n      @private\n    */\n    _registerHandlers: function _registerHandlers(target, becameInvalid, becameValid) {\n      this.on('becameInvalid', target, becameInvalid);\n      this.on('becameValid', target, becameValid);\n    },\n\n\n    /**\n      @property errorsByAttributeName\n      @type {MapWithDefault}\n      @private\n    */\n    errorsByAttributeName: Ember.computed(function () {\n      return new MapWithDefault({\n        defaultValue: function defaultValue() {\n          return Ember.A();\n        }\n      });\n    }),\n\n    /**\n      Returns errors for a given attribute\n       ```javascript\n      let user = store.createRecord('user', {\n        username: 'tomster',\n        email: 'invalidEmail'\n      });\n      user.save().catch(function(){\n        user.get('errors').errorsFor('email'); // returns:\n        // [{attribute: \"email\", message: \"Doesn't look like a valid email.\"}]\n      });\n      ```\n       @method errorsFor\n      @param {String} attribute\n      @return {Array}\n    */\n    errorsFor: function errorsFor(attribute) {\n      return Ember.get(this, 'errorsByAttributeName').get(attribute);\n    },\n\n\n    /**\n      An array containing all of the error messages for this\n      record.

For instance, if a record is\n    newly created and has not yet been sent to the adapter to be saved,\n    it would be in the `root.loaded.created.uncommitted` state.  If a\n    record has had local modifications made to it that are in the\n    process of being saved, the record would be in the\n    `root.loaded.updated.inFlight` state. (This state path will be\n    explained in more detail below.)\n\n    Events are sent by the record or its store to the record's\n    `currentState` property. How the state reacts to these events is\n    dependent on which state it is in. In some states, certain events\n    will be invalid and will cause an exception to be raised.\n\n    States are hierarchical and every state is a sub-state of the\n    `RootState`. For example, a record can be in the\n    `root.deleted.uncommitted` state then transitions into the\n    `root.deleted.inFlight` state. If a child state does not implement\n    an event handler, the state manager will attempt to invoke the event\n    on all parent states until the root state is reached. The state\n    hierarchy of a record is described in terms of a path string. You\n    can determine a record's current state by getting the state's\n    `stateName` property:\n\n    ```javascript\n    record.get('currentState.stateName');\n    //=> \"root.created.uncommitted\"\n     ```\n\n    The hierarchy of valid states that ship with ember data looks like\n    this:\n\n    ```text\n    * root\n      * deleted\n        * saved\n        * uncommitted\n        * inFlight\n      * empty\n      * loaded\n        * created\n          * uncommitted\n          * inFlight\n        * saved\n        * updated\n          * uncommitted\n          * inFlight\n      * loading\n    ```\n\n    The `DS.Model` states are themselves stateless. What that means is\n    that, the hierarchical states that each of *those* points to is a\n    shared data structure. For performance reasons, instead of each\n    record getting its own copy of the hierarchy of states, each record\n    points to this global, immutable shared instance. How does a state\n    know which record it should be acting on? We pass the record\n    instance into the state's event handlers as the first argument.\n\n    The record passed as the first parameter is where you should stash\n    state about the record if needed; you should never store data on the state\n    object itself.\n\n    ### Events and Flags\n\n    A state may implement zero or more events and flags.\n\n    #### Events\n\n    Events are named functions that are invoked when sent to a record. The\n    record will first look for a method with the given name on the\n    current state. If no method is found, it will search the current\n    state's parent, and then its grandparent, and so on until reaching\n    the top of the hierarchy. If the root is reached without an event\n    handler being found, an exception will be raised. This can be very\n    helpful when debugging new features.\n\n    Here's an example implementation of a state with a `myEvent` event handler:\n\n    ```javascript\n    aState: DS.State.create({\n      myEvent: function(manager, param) {\n        console.log(\"Received myEvent with\", param);\n      }\n    })\n    ```\n\n    To trigger this event:\n\n    ```javascript\n    record.send('myEvent', 'foo');\n    //=> \"Received myEvent with foo\"\n    ```\n\n    Note that an optional parameter can be sent to a record's `send()` method,\n    which will be passed as the second parameter to the event handler.\n\n    Events should transition to a different state if appropriate. This can be\n    done by calling the record's `transitionTo()` method with a path to the\n    desired state. The state manager will attempt to resolve the state path\n    relative to the current state. If no state is found at that path, it will\n    attempt to resolve it relative to the current state's parent, and then its\n    parent, and so on until the root is reached. For example, imagine a hierarchy\n    like this:\n\n        * created\n          * uncommitted <-- currentState\n          * inFlight\n        * updated\n          * inFlight\n\n    If we are currently in the `uncommitted` state, calling\n    `transitionTo('inFlight')` would transition to the `created.inFlight` state,\n    while calling `transitionTo('updated.inFlight')` would transition to\n    the `updated.inFlight` state.\n\n    Remember that *only events* should ever cause a state transition. You should\n    never call `transitionTo()` from outside a state's event handler. If you are\n    tempted to do so, create a new event and send that to the state manager.\n\n    #### Flags\n\n    Flags are Boolean values that can be used to introspect a record's current\n    state in a more user-friendly way than examining its state path. For example,\n    instead of doing this:\n\n    ```javascript\n    var statePath = record.get('stateManager.currentPath');\n    if (statePath === 'created.inFlight') {\n      doSomething();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can say:\n\n    ```javascript\n    if (record.get('isNew') && record.get('isSaving')) {\n      doSomething();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    If your state does not set a value for a given flag, the value will\n    be inherited from its parent (or the first place in the state hierarchy\n    where it is defined).\n\n    The current set of flags are defined below. If you want to add a new flag,\n    in addition to the area below, you will also need to declare it in the\n    `DS.Model` class.\n\n\n     * [isEmpty](DS.Model.html#property_isEmpty)\n     * [isLoading](DS.Model.html#property_isLoading)\n     * [isLoaded](DS.Model.html#property_isLoaded)\n     * [hasDirtyAttributes](DS.Model.html#property_hasDirtyAttributes)\n     * [isSaving](DS.Model.html#property_isSaving)\n     * [isDeleted](DS.Model.html#property_isDeleted)\n     * [isNew](DS.Model.html#property_isNew)\n     * [isValid](DS.Model.html#property_isValid)\n\n    @namespace DS\n    @class RootState\n  */\n\n  function _didSetProperty(internalModel, context) {\n    if (context.isDirty) {\n      internalModel.send('becomeDirty');\n    } else {\n      internalModel.send('propertyWasReset');\n    }\n\n    internalModel.updateRecordArrays();\n  }\n\n  // Implementation notes:\n  //\n  // Each state has a boolean value for all of the following flags:\n  //\n  // * isLoaded: The record has a populated `data` property. When a\n  //   record is loaded via `store.find`, `isLoaded` is false\n  //   until the adapter sets it. When a record is created locally,\n  //   its `isLoaded` property is always true.\n  // * isDirty: The record has local changes that have not yet been\n  //   saved by the adapter. This includes records that have been\n  //   created (but not yet saved) or deleted.\n  // * isSaving: The record has been committed, but\n  //   the adapter has not yet acknowledged that the changes have\n  //   been persisted to the backend.\n  // * isDeleted: The record was marked for deletion.

To retrieve a record\n    for a specific id, use `DS.Store`'s `findRecord()` method:\n\n    ```javascript\n    store.findRecord('person', 123).then(function (person) {\n    });\n    ```\n\n    By default, the store will talk to your backend using a standard\n    REST mechanism. You can customize how the store talks to your\n    backend by specifying a custom adapter:\n\n    ```app/adapters/application.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n\n    export default DS.Adapter.extend({\n    });\n    ```\n\n    You can learn more about writing a custom adapter by reading the `DS.Adapter`\n    documentation.\n\n    ### Store createRecord() vs. push() vs. pushPayload()\n\n    The store provides multiple ways to create new record objects. They have\n    some subtle differences in their use which are detailed below:\n\n    [createRecord](#method_createRecord) is used for creating new\n    records on the client side. This will return a new record in the\n    `created.uncommitted` state. In order to persist this record to the\n    backend, you will need to call `record.save()`.\n\n    [push](#method_push) is used to notify Ember Data's store of new or\n    updated records that exist in the backend. This will return a record\n    in the `loaded.saved` state. The primary use-case for `store#push` is\n    to notify Ember Data about record updates (full or partial) that happen\n    outside of the normal adapter methods (for example\n    [SSE](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) or [Web\n    Sockets](http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-websockets-20091222/)).\n\n    [pushPayload](#method_pushPayload) is a convenience wrapper for\n    `store#push` that will deserialize payloads if the\n    Serializer implements a `pushPayload` method.\n\n    Note: When creating a new record using any of the above methods\n    Ember Data will update `DS.RecordArray`s such as those returned by\n    `store#peekAll()` or `store#findAll()`. This means any\n    data bindings or computed properties that depend on the RecordArray\n    will automatically be synced to include the new or updated record\n    values.\n\n    @class Store\n    @namespace DS\n    @extends Ember.Service\n  */\n  Store = Ember.Service.extend({\n    /**\n      @method init\n      @private\n    */\n    init: function init() {\n\n      this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n      this._backburner = backburner;\n      // internal bookkeeping; not observable\n      this.recordArrayManager = new RecordArrayManager({ store: this });\n      this._identityMap = new IdentityMap();\n      // To keep track of clientIds for newly created records\n      this._newlyCreated = new IdentityMap();\n      this._pendingSave = [];\n      this._modelFactoryCache = Object.create(null);\n      this._relationshipsDefCache = Object.create(null);\n      this._attributesDefCache = Object.create(null);\n\n      /*\n        Ember Data uses several specialized micro-queues for organizing\n        and coalescing similar async work.\n         These queues are currently controlled by a flush scheduled into\n        ember-data's custom backburner instance.\n       */\n      // used for coalescing record save requests\n      this._pendingSave = [];\n      // used for coalescing relationship updates\n      this._updatedRelationships = [];\n      // used for coalescing relationship setup needs\n      this._pushedInternalModels = [];\n      // used for coalescing internal model updates\n      this._updatedInternalModels = [];\n\n      // used to keep track of all the find requests that need to be coalesced\n      this._pendingFetch = new MapWithDefault({\n        defaultValue: function defaultValue() {\n          return [];\n        }\n      });\n\n      this._adapterCache = Object.create(null);\n      this._serializerCache = Object.create(null);\n\n      this.recordDataWrapper = new RecordDataWrapper(this);\n    },\n\n\n    /**\n      The default adapter to use to communicate to a backend server or\n      other persistence layer.

If the record is already present in the\n      store, it depends on the reload behavior _when_ the returned promise\n      resolves.\n       ### Preloading\n       You can optionally `preload` specific attributes and relationships that you know of\n      by passing them via the passed `options`.\n       For example, if your Ember route looks like `/posts/1/comments/2` and your API route\n      for the comment also looks like `/posts/1/comments/2` if you want to fetch the comment\n      without fetching the post you can pass in the post to the `findRecord` call:\n       ```javascript\n      store.findRecord('comment', 2, { preload: { post: 1 } });\n      ```\n       If you have access to the post model you can also pass the model itself:\n       ```javascript\n      store.findRecord('post', 1).then(function (myPostModel) {\n        store.findRecord('comment', 2, { post: myPostModel });\n      });\n      ```\n       ### Reloading\n       The reload behavior is configured either via the passed `options` hash or\n      the result of the adapter's `shouldReloadRecord`.\n       If `{ reload: true }` is passed or `adapter.shouldReloadRecord` evaluates\n      to `true`, then the returned promise resolves once the adapter returns\n      data, regardless if the requested record is already in the store:\n       ```js\n      store.push({\n        data: {\n          id: 1,\n          type: 'post',\n          revision: 1\n        }\n      });\n       // adapter#findRecord resolves with\n      // [\n      //   {\n      //     id: 1,\n      //     type: 'post',\n      //     revision: 2\n      //   }\n      // ]\n      store.findRecord('post', 1, { reload: true }).then(function(post) {\n        post.get('revision'); // 2\n      });\n      ```\n       If no reload is indicated via the abovementioned ways, then the promise\n      immediately resolves with the cached version in the store.\n       ### Background Reloading\n       Optionally, if `adapter.shouldBackgroundReloadRecord` evaluates to `true`,\n      then a background reload is started, which updates the records' data, once\n      it is available:\n       ```js\n      // app/adapters/post.js\n      import ApplicationAdapter from \"./application\";\n       export default ApplicationAdapter.extend({\n        shouldReloadRecord(store, snapshot) {\n          return false;\n        },\n         shouldBackgroundReloadRecord(store, snapshot) {\n          return true;\n        }\n      });\n       // ...\n       store.push({\n        data: {\n          id: 1,\n          type: 'post',\n          revision: 1\n        }\n      });\n       let blogPost = store.findRecord('post', 1).then(function(post) {\n        post.get('revision'); // 1\n      });\n       // later, once adapter#findRecord resolved with\n      // [\n      //   {\n      //     id: 1,\n      //     type: 'post',\n      //     revision: 2\n      //   }\n      // ]\n       blogPost.get('revision'); // 2\n      ```\n       If you would like to force or prevent background reloading, you can set a\n      boolean value for `backgroundReload` in the options object for\n      `findRecord`.\n       ```app/routes/post/edit.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        model(params) {\n          return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id, { backgroundReload: false });\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       If you pass an object on the `adapterOptions` property of the options\n      argument it will be passed to you adapter via the snapshot\n       ```app/routes/post/edit.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        model(params) {\n          return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id, {\n            adapterOptions: { subscribe: false }\n          });\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/adapters/post.js\n      import MyCustomAdapter from './custom-adapter';\n       export default MyCustomAdapter.extend({\n        findRecord(store, type, id, snapshot) {\n          if (snapshot.adapterOptions.subscribe) {\n            // ...\n          }\n          // ...\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       See [peekRecord](#method_peekRecord) to get the cached version of a record.\n       ### Retrieving Related Model Records\n       If you use an adapter such as Ember's default\n      [`JSONAPIAdapter`](https://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.JSONAPIAdapter.html)\n      that supports the [JSON API specification](http://jsonapi.org/) and if your server\n      endpoint supports the use of an\n      ['include' query parameter](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes),\n      you can use `findRecord()` to automatically retrieve additional records related to\n      the one you request by supplying an `include` parameter in the `options` object.\n       For example, given a `post` model that has a `hasMany` relationship with a `comment`\n      model, when we retrieve a specific post we can have the server also return that post's\n      comments in the same request:\n       ```app/routes/post.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        model(params) {\n          return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id, { include: 'comments' });\n        }\n      });\n       ```\n      In this case, the post's comments would then be available in your template as\n      `model.comments`.\n       Multiple relationships can be requested using an `include` parameter consisting of a\n      comma-separated list (without white-space) while nested relationships can be specified\n      using a dot-separated sequence of relationship names. So to request both the post's\n      comments and the authors of those comments the request would look like this:\n       ```app/routes/post.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        model(params) {\n          return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id, { include: 'comments,comments.author' });\n        }\n      });\n       ```\n       @since 1.13.0\n      @method findRecord\n      @param {String} modelName\n      @param {(String|Integer)} id\n      @param {Object} preload - optional set of attributes and relationships passed in either as IDs or as actual models\n      @param {Object} options\n      @return {Promise} promise\n    */\n    findRecord: function findRecord(modelName, id, options) {\n\n\n      var normalizedModelName = normalizeModelName(modelName);\n\n      var internalModel = this._internalModelForId(normalizedModelName, id);\n      options = options || {};\n\n      if (!this.hasRecordForId(normalizedModelName, id)) {\n        return this._findByInternalModel(internalModel, options);\n      }\n\n      var fetchedInternalModel = this._findRecord(internalModel, options);\n\n      return promiseRecord(fetchedInternalModel, 'DS: Store#findRecord ' + normalizedModelName + ' with id: ' + id);\n    },\n    _findRecord: function _findRecord(internalModel, options) {\n      // Refetch if the reload option is passed\n      if (options.reload) {\n        return this._scheduleFetch(internalModel, options);\n      }\n\n      var snapshot = internalModel.createSnapshot(options);\n      var adapter = this.adapterFor(internalModel.modelName);\n\n      // Refetch the record if the adapter thinks the record is stale\n      if (adapter.shouldReloadRecord(this, snapshot)) {\n        return this._scheduleFetch(internalModel, options);\n      }\n\n      if (options.backgroundReload === false) {\n        return Ember.RSVP.Promise.resolve(internalModel);\n      }\n\n      // Trigger the background refetch if backgroundReload option is passed\n      if (options.backgroundReload || adapter.shouldBackgroundReloadRecord(this, snapshot)) {\n        this._scheduleFetch(internalModel, options);\n      }\n\n      // Return the cached record\n      return Ember.RSVP.Promise.resolve(internalModel);\n    },\n    _findByInternalModel: function _findByInternalModel(internalModel) {\n      var options = arguments.length > 1 && arguments[1] !== undefined ?

Once this resolves, the array with\n      which the promise resolves, is updated automatically so it contains all the\n      records in the store:\n       ```app/adapters/application.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data';\n      export default DS.Adapter.extend({\n        shouldReloadAll(store, snapshotsArray) {\n          return false;\n        },\n         shouldBackgroundReloadAll(store, snapshotsArray) {\n          return true;\n        }\n      });\n       // ...\n       store.push({\n        data: {\n          id: 'first',\n          type: 'author'\n        }\n      });\n       let allAuthors;\n      store.findAll('author').then(function(authors) {\n        authors.getEach('id'); // ['first']\n         allAuthors = authors;\n      });\n       // later, once adapter#findAll resolved with\n      // [\n      //   {\n      //     id: 'second',\n      //     type: 'author'\n      //   }\n      // ]\n       allAuthors.getEach('id'); // ['first', 'second']\n      ```\n       If you would like to force or prevent background reloading, you can set a\n      boolean value for `backgroundReload` in the options object for\n      `findAll`.\n       ```app/routes/post/edit.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        model() {\n          return this.store.findAll('post', { backgroundReload: false });\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       If you pass an object on the `adapterOptions` property of the options\n      argument it will be passed to you adapter via the `snapshotRecordArray`\n       ```app/routes/posts.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        model(params) {\n          return this.store.findAll('post', {\n            adapterOptions: { subscribe: false }\n          });\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/adapters/post.js\n      import MyCustomAdapter from './custom-adapter';\n       export default MyCustomAdapter.extend({\n        findAll(store, type, sinceToken, snapshotRecordArray) {\n          if (snapshotRecordArray.adapterOptions.subscribe) {\n            // ...\n          }\n          // ...\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       See [peekAll](#method_peekAll) to get an array of current records in the\n      store, without waiting until a reload is finished.\n       ### Retrieving Related Model Records\n       If you use an adapter such as Ember's default\n      [`JSONAPIAdapter`](https://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.JSONAPIAdapter.html)\n      that supports the [JSON API specification](http://jsonapi.org/) and if your server\n      endpoint supports the use of an\n      ['include' query parameter](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes),\n      you can use `findAll()` to automatically retrieve additional records related to\n      those requested by supplying an `include` parameter in the `options` object.\n       For example, given a `post` model that has a `hasMany` relationship with a `comment`\n      model, when we retrieve all of the post records we can have the server also return\n      all of the posts' comments in the same request:\n       ```app/routes/posts.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        model() {\n          return this.store.findAll('post', { include: 'comments' });\n        }\n      });\n       ```\n      Multiple relationships can be requested using an `include` parameter consisting of a\n      comma-separated list (without white-space) while nested relationships can be specified\n      using a dot-separated sequence of relationship names. So to request both the posts'\n      comments and the authors of those comments the request would look like this:\n       ```app/routes/posts.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        model() {\n          return this.store.findAll('post', { include: 'comments,comments.author' });\n        }\n      });\n       ```\n       See [query](#method_query) to only get a subset of records from the server.\n       @since 1.13.0\n      @method findAll\n      @param {String} modelName\n      @param {Object} options\n      @return {Promise} promise\n    */\n    findAll: function findAll(modelName, options) {\n\n      var normalizedModelName = normalizeModelName(modelName);\n      var fetch = this._fetchAll(normalizedModelName, this.peekAll(normalizedModelName), options);\n\n      return fetch;\n    },\n\n\n    /**\n      @method _fetchAll\n      @private\n      @param {DS.Model} modelName\n      @param {DS.RecordArray} array\n      @return {Promise} promise\n    */\n    _fetchAll: function _fetchAll(modelName, array) {\n      var options = arguments.length > 2 && arguments[2] !== undefined ? arguments[2] : {};\n\n      var adapter = this.adapterFor(modelName);\n      var sinceToken = this._internalModelsFor(modelName).metadata.since;\n\n\n      if (options.reload) {\n        Ember.set(array, 'isUpdating', true);\n        return promiseArray(_findAll(adapter, this, modelName, sinceToken, options));\n      }\n\n      var snapshotArray = array._createSnapshot(options);\n\n      if (adapter.shouldReloadAll(this, snapshotArray)) {\n        Ember.set(array, 'isUpdating', true);\n        return promiseArray(_findAll(adapter, this, modelName, sinceToken, options));\n      }\n\n      if (options.backgroundReload === false) {\n        return promiseArray(Ember.RSVP.Promise.resolve(array));\n      }\n\n      if (options.backgroundReload || adapter.shouldBackgroundReloadAll(this, snapshotArray)) {\n        Ember.set(array, 'isUpdating', true);\n        _findAll(adapter, this, modelName, sinceToken, options);\n      }\n\n      return promiseArray(Ember.RSVP.Promise.resolve(array));\n    },\n\n\n    /**\n      @method _didUpdateAll\n      @param {String} modelName\n      @private\n    */\n    _didUpdateAll: function _didUpdateAll(modelName) {\n      this.recordArrayManager._didUpdateAll(modelName);\n    },\n\n\n    /**\n      This method returns a filtered array that contains all of the\n      known records for a given type in the store.\n       Note that because it's just a filter, the result will contain any\n      locally created records of the type, however, it will not make a\n      request to the backend to retrieve additional records.

attribute on a [DS.Model](/api/data/classes/DS.Model.html).\n    By default, attributes are passed through as-is, however you can specify an\n    optional type to have the value automatically transformed.\n    Ember Data ships with four basic transform types: `string`, `number`,\n    `boolean` and `date`. You can define your own transforms by subclassing\n    [DS.Transform](/api/data/classes/DS.Transform.html).\n\n    Note that you cannot use `attr` to define an attribute of `id`.\n\n    `DS.attr` takes an optional hash as a second parameter, currently\n    supported options are:\n\n    - `defaultValue`: Pass a string or a function to be called to set the attribute\n    to a default value if none is supplied.\n\n    Example\n\n    ```app/models/user.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n\n    export default DS.Model.extend({\n      username: DS.attr('string'),\n      email: DS.attr('string'),\n      verified: DS.attr('boolean', { defaultValue: false })\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Default value can also be a function. This is useful it you want to return\n    a new object for each attribute.\n\n    ```app/models/user.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n\n    export default DS.Model.extend({\n      username: DS.attr('string'),\n      email: DS.attr('string'),\n      settings: DS.attr({\n        defaultValue() {\n          return {};\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n\n    The `options` hash is passed as second argument to a transforms'\n    `serialize` and `deserialize` method. This allows to configure a\n    transformation and adapt the corresponding value, based on the config:\n\n    ```app/models/post.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n\n    export default DS.Model.extend({\n      text: DS.attr('text', {\n        uppercase: true\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n\n    ```app/transforms/text.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n\n    export default

It\n    is responsible for transforming the store's requests into HTTP\n    requests that follow the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/format/)\n    format.\n  \n    ## JSON API Conventions\n  \n    The JSONAPIAdapter uses JSON API conventions for building the URL\n    for a record and selecting the HTTP verb to use with a request. The\n    actions you can take on a record map onto the following URLs in the\n    JSON API adapter:\n  \n  <table>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\n        Action\n      </th>\n      <th>\n        HTTP Verb\n      </th>\n      <th>\n        URL\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\n        `store.findRecord('post', 123)`\n      </th>\n      <td>\n        GET\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        /posts/123\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\n        `store.findAll('post')`\n      </th>\n      <td>\n        GET\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        /posts\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\n        Update `postRecord.save()`\n      </th>\n      <td>\n        PATCH\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        /posts/123\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\n        Create `store.createRecord('post').save()`\n      </th>\n      <td>\n        POST\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        /posts\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\n        Delete `postRecord.destroyRecord()`\n      </th>\n      <td>\n        DELETE\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        /posts/123\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n  \n    ## Success and failure\n  \n    The JSONAPIAdapter will consider a success any response with a\n    status code of the 2xx family (\"Success\"), as well as 304 (\"Not\n    Modified\"). Any other status code will be considered a failure.\n  \n    On success, the request promise will be resolved with the full\n    response payload.\n  \n    Failed responses with status code 422 (\"Unprocessable Entity\") will\n    be considered \"invalid\". The response will be discarded, except for\n    the `errors` key. The request promise will be rejected with a\n    `DS.InvalidError`. This error object will encapsulate the saved\n    `errors` value.\n  \n    Any other status codes will be treated as an adapter error. The\n    request promise will be rejected, similarly to the invalid case,\n    but with an instance of `DS.AdapterError` instead.\n  \n    ### Endpoint path customization\n  \n    Endpoint paths can be prefixed with a `namespace` by setting the\n    namespace property on the adapter:\n  \n    ```app/adapters/application.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.JSONAPIAdapter.extend({\n      namespace: 'api/1'\n    });\n    ```\n    Requests for the `person` model would now target `/api/1/people/1`.\n  \n    ### Host customization\n  \n    An adapter can target other hosts by setting the `host` property.\n  \n    ```app/adapters/application.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.JSONAPIAdapter.extend({\n      host: 'https://api.example.com'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Requests for the `person` model would now target\n    `https://api.example.com/people/1`.\n  \n    @since 1.13.0\n    @class JSONAPIAdapter\n    @constructor\n    @namespace DS\n    @extends DS.RESTAdapter\n  */\n  var JSONAPIAdapter = _rest.default.extend({\n    defaultSerializer: '-json-api',\n\n    ajaxOptions: function ajaxOptions(url, type, options) {\n      var hash = this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n\n      if (hash.contentType) {\n        hash.contentType = 'application/vnd.api+json';\n      }\n\n      var beforeSend = hash.beforeSend;\n      hash.beforeSend = function (xhr) {\n        xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/vnd.api+json');\n        if (beforeSend) {\n          beforeSend(xhr);\n        }\n      };\n\n      return hash;\n    },\n\n\n    /**\n      By default the JSONAPIAdapter will send each find request coming from a `store.find`\n      or from accessing a relationship separately to the server. If your server supports passing\n      ids as a query string, you can set coalesceFindRequests to true to coalesce all find requests\n      within a single runloop.\n       For example, if you have an initial payload of:\n       ```javascript\n      {\n        data: {\n          id: 1,\n          type: 'post',\n          relationship: {\n            comments: {\n              data: [\n                { id: 1, type: 'comment' },\n                { id: 2, type: 'comment' }\n              ]\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n       By default calling `post.get('comments')` will trigger the following requests(assuming the\n      comments haven't been loaded before):\n       ```\n      GET /comments/1\n      GET /comments/2\n      ```\n       If you set coalesceFindRequests to `true` it will instead trigger the following request:\n       ```\n      GET /comments?filter[id]=1,2\n      ```\n       Setting coalesceFindRequests to `true` also works for `store.find` requests and `belongsTo`\n      relationships accessed within the same runloop. If you set `coalesceFindRequests: true`\n       ```javascript\n      store.findRecord('comment', 1);\n      store.findRecord('comment', 2);\n      ```\n       will also send a request to: `GET /comments?filter[id]=1,2`\n       Note: Requests coalescing rely on URL building strategy. So if you override `buildURL` in your app\n      `groupRecordsForFindMany` more likely should be overridden as well in order for coalescing to work.\n       @property coalesceFindRequests\n      @type {boolean}\n    */\n    coalesceFindRequests: false,\n\n    findMany: function findMany(store, type, ids, snapshots) {\n      var url = this.buildURL(type.modelName, ids, snapshots, 'findMany');\n      return this.ajax(url, 'GET', { data: { filter: { id: ids.join(',') } } });\n    },\n    pathForType: function pathForType(modelName) {\n      var dasherized = Ember.String.dasherize(modelName);\n      return (0, _emberInflector.pluralize)(dasherized);\n    },\n    updateRecord: function updateRecord(store, type, snapshot) {\n      var data = {};\n      var serializer = store.serializerFor(type.modelName);\n\n      serializer.serializeIntoHash(data, type, snapshot, { includeId: true });\n\n      var url = this.buildURL(type.modelName, snapshot.id, snapshot, 'updateRecord');\n\n      return this.ajax(url, 'PATCH', { data: data });\n    }\n  }); /* global heimdall */\n  /**\n    @module ember-data\n  */\n  exports.default = JSONAPIAdapter;\n});","define('ember-data/adapters/rest', ['exports', 'ember-data/adapter', 'ember-data/-private'], function (exports, _adapter, _private) {\n  'use strict';\n\n  Object.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n    value: true\n  });\n\n\n  var Promise = Ember.RSVP.Promise;\n\n  /**\n    The REST adapter allows your store to communicate with an HTTP server by\n    transmitting JSON via XHR. Most Ember.js apps that consume a JSON API\n    should use the REST adapter.\n  \n    This adapter is designed around the idea that the JSON exchanged with\n    the server should be conventional.\n  \n    ## Success and failure\n  \n    The REST adapter will consider a success any response with a status code\n    of the 2xx family (\"Success\"), as well as 304 (\"Not Modified\"). Any other\n    status code will be considered a failure.\n  \n    On success, the request promise will be resolved with the full response\n    payload.\n  \n    Failed responses with status code 422 (\"Unprocessable Entity\") will be\n    considered \"invalid\". The response will be discarded, except for the\n    `errors` key. The request promise will be rejected with a `DS.InvalidError`.\n    This error object will encapsulate the saved `errors` value.\n  \n    Any other status codes will be treated as an \"adapter error\". The request\n    promise will be rejected, similarly to the \"invalid\" case, but with\n    an instance of `DS.AdapterError` instead.\n  \n    ## JSON Structure\n  \n    The REST adapter expects the JSON returned from your server to follow\n    these conventions.\n  \n    ### Object Root\n  \n    The JSON payload should be an object that contains the record inside a\n    root property. For example, in response to a `GET` request for\n    `/posts/1`, the JSON should look like this:\n  \n    ```js\n    {\n      \"posts\": {\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"I'm Running to Reform the W3C's Tag\",\n        \"author\": \"Yehuda Katz\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Similarly, in response to a `GET` request for `/posts`, the JSON should\n    look like this:\n  \n    ```js\n    {\n      \"posts\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": 1,\n          \"title\": \"I'm Running to Reform the W3C's Tag\",\n          \"author\": \"Yehuda Katz\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": 2,\n          \"title\": \"Rails is omakase\",\n          \"author\": \"D2H\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Note that the object root can be pluralized for both a single-object response\n    and an array response: the REST adapter is not strict on this. Further, if the\n    HTTP server responds to a `GET` request to `/posts/1` (e.g. the response to a\n    `findRecord` query) with more than one object in the array, Ember Data will\n    only display the object with the matching ID.\n  \n    ### Conventional Names\n  \n    Attribute names in your JSON payload should be the camelCased versions of\n    the attributes in your Ember.js models.\n  \n    For example, if you have a `Person` model:\n  \n    ```app/models/person.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.Model.extend({\n      firstName: DS.attr('string'),\n      lastName: DS.attr('string'),\n      occupation: DS.attr('string')\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    The JSON returned should look like this:\n  \n    ```js\n    {\n      \"people\": {\n        \"id\": 5,\n        \"firstName\": \"Zaphod\",\n        \"lastName\": \"Beeblebrox\",\n        \"occupation\": \"President\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    #### Relationships\n  \n    Relationships are usually represented by ids to the record in the\n    relationship. The related records can then be sideloaded in the\n    response under a key for the type.\n  \n    ```js\n    {\n      \"posts\": {\n        \"id\": 5,\n        \"title\": \"I'm Running to Reform the W3C's Tag\",\n        \"author\": \"Yehuda Katz\",\n        \"comments\": [1, 2]\n      },\n      \"comments\": [{\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"author\": \"User 1\",\n        \"message\": \"First!\",\n      }, {\n        \"id\": 2,\n        \"author\": \"User 2\",\n        \"message\": \"Good Luck!\",\n      }]\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    If the records in the relationship are not known when the response\n    is serialized it's also possible to represent the relationship as a\n    URL using the `links` key in the response. Ember Data will fetch\n    this URL to resolve the relationship when it is accessed for the\n    first time.\n  \n    ```js\n    {\n      \"posts\": {\n        \"id\": 5,\n        \"title\": \"I'm Running to Reform the W3C's Tag\",\n        \"author\": \"Yehuda Katz\",\n        \"links\": {\n          \"comments\": \"/posts/5/comments\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    ### Errors\n  \n    If a response is considered a failure, the JSON payload is expected to include\n    a top-level key `errors`, detailing any specific issues. For example:\n  \n    ```js\n    {\n      \"errors\": {\n        \"msg\": \"Something went wrong\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    This adapter does not make any assumptions as to the format of the `errors`\n    object. It will simply be passed along as is, wrapped in an instance\n    of `DS.InvalidError` or `DS.AdapterError`. The serializer can interpret it\n    afterwards.\n  \n    ## Customization\n  \n    ### Endpoint path customization\n  \n    Endpoint paths can be prefixed with a `namespace` by setting the namespace\n    property on the adapter:\n  \n    ```app/adapters/application.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({\n      namespace: 'api/1'\n    });\n    ```\n    Requests for the `Person` model would now target `/api/1/people/1`.\n  \n    ### Host customization\n  \n    An adapter can target other hosts by setting the `host` property.\n  \n    ```app/adapters/application.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({\n      host: 'https://api.example.com'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ### Headers customization\n  \n    Some APIs require HTTP headers, e.g. to provide an API key. Arbitrary\n    headers can be set as key/value pairs on the `RESTAdapter`'s `headers`\n    object and Ember Data will send them along with each ajax request.\n  \n  \n    ```app/adapters/application.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n    import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({\n      headers: computed(function() {\n        return {\n          'API_KEY': 'secret key',\n          'ANOTHER_HEADER': 'Some header value'\n        };\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    `headers` can also be used as a computed property to support dynamic\n    headers. In the example below, the `session` object has been\n    injected into an adapter by Ember's container.\n  \n    ```app/adapters/application.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n    import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({\n      headers: computed('session.authToken', function() {\n        return {\n          'API_KEY': this.get('session.authToken'),\n          'ANOTHER_HEADER': 'Some header value'\n        };\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    In some cases, your dynamic headers may require data from some\n    object outside of Ember's observer system (for example\n    `document.cookie`). You can use the\n    [volatile](/api/classes/Ember.ComputedProperty.html#method_volatile)\n    function to set the property into a non-cached mode causing the headers to\n    be recomputed with every request.\n  \n    ```app/adapters/application.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n    import { get } from '@ember/object';\n    import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({\n      headers: computed(function() {\n        return {\n          'API_KEY': get(document.cookie.match(/apiKey\\=([^;]*)/), '1'),\n          'ANOTHER_HEADER': 'Some header value'\n        };\n      }).volatile()\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @class RESTAdapter\n    @constructor\n    @namespace DS\n    @extends DS.Adapter\n    @uses DS.BuildURLMixin\n  */\n  /* global heimdall */\n  /* globals najax */\n  /**\n    @module ember-data\n  */\n\n  var RESTAdapter = _adapter.default.extend(_private.BuildURLMixin, {\n    defaultSerializer: '-rest',\n\n    fastboot: Ember.computed(function () {\n      return Ember.getOwner(this).lookup('service:fastboot');\n    }),\n\n    sortQueryParams: function sortQueryParams(obj) {\n      var keys = Object.keys(obj);\n      var len = keys.length;\n      if (len < 2) {\n        return obj;\n      }\n      var newQueryParams = {};\n      var sortedKeys = keys.sort();\n\n      for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        newQueryParams[sortedKeys[i]] = obj[sortedKeys[i]];\n      }\n      return newQueryParams;\n    },\n\n\n    /**\n      By default the RESTAdapter will send each find request coming from a `store.find`\n      or from accessing a relationship separately to the server.

So if you override `buildURL` in your app\n      `groupRecordsForFindMany` more likely should be overridden as well in order for coalescing to work.\n       @property coalesceFindRequests\n      @type {boolean}\n    */\n    coalesceFindRequests: false,\n\n    findRecord: function findRecord(store, type, id, snapshot) {\n      var url = this.buildURL(type.modelName, id, snapshot, 'findRecord');\n      var query = this.buildQuery(snapshot);\n\n      return this.ajax(url, 'GET', { data: query });\n    },\n    findAll: function findAll(store, type, sinceToken, snapshotRecordArray) {\n      var query = this.buildQuery(snapshotRecordArray);\n      var url = this.buildURL(type.modelName, null, snapshotRecordArray, 'findAll');\n\n      if (sinceToken) {\n        query.since = sinceToken;\n      }\n\n      return this.ajax(url, 'GET', { data: query });\n    },\n    query: function query(store, type, _query) {\n      var url = this.buildURL(type.modelName, null, null, 'query', _query);\n\n      if (this.sortQueryParams) {\n        _query = this.sortQueryParams(_query);\n      }\n\n      return this.ajax(url, 'GET', { data: _query });\n    },\n    queryRecord: function queryRecord(store, type, query) {\n      var url = this.buildURL(type.modelName, null, null, 'queryRecord', query);\n\n      if (this.sortQueryParams) {\n        query = this.sortQueryParams(query);\n      }\n\n      return this.ajax(url, 'GET', { data: query });\n    },\n    findMany: function findMany(store, type, ids, snapshots) {\n      var url = this.buildURL(type.modelName, ids, snapshots, 'findMany');\n      return this.ajax(url, 'GET', { data: { ids: ids } });\n    },\n    findHasMany: function findHasMany(store, snapshot, url, relationship) {\n      var id = snapshot.id;\n      var type = snapshot.modelName;\n\n      url = this.urlPrefix(url, this.buildURL(type, id, snapshot, 'findHasMany'));\n\n      return this.ajax(url, 'GET');\n    },\n    findBelongsTo: function findBelongsTo(store, snapshot, url, relationship) {\n      var id = snapshot.id;\n      var type = snapshot.modelName;\n\n      url = this.urlPrefix(url, this.buildURL(type, id, snapshot, 'findBelongsTo'));\n      return this.ajax(url, 'GET');\n    },\n    createRecord: function createRecord(store, type, snapshot) {\n      var data = {};\n      var serializer = store.serializerFor(type.modelName);\n      var url = this.buildURL(type.modelName, null, snapshot, 'createRecord');\n\n      serializer.serializeIntoHash(data, type, snapshot, { includeId: true });\n\n      return this.ajax(url, 'POST', { data: data });\n    },\n    updateRecord: function updateRecord(store, type, snapshot) {\n      var data = {};\n      var serializer = store.serializerFor(type.modelName);\n\n      serializer.serializeIntoHash(data, type, snapshot);\n\n      var id = snapshot.id;\n      var url = this.buildURL(type.modelName, id, snapshot, 'updateRecord');\n\n      return this.ajax(url, 'PUT', { data: data });\n    },\n    deleteRecord: function deleteRecord(store, type, snapshot) {\n      var id = snapshot.id;\n\n      return this.ajax(this.buildURL(type.modelName, id, snapshot, 'deleteRecord'), 'DELETE');\n    },\n    _stripIDFromURL: function _stripIDFromURL(store, snapshot) {\n      var url = this.buildURL(snapshot.modelName, snapshot.id, snapshot);\n\n      var expandedURL = url.split('/');\n      // Case when the url is of the format ...something/:id\n      // We are decodeURIComponent-ing the lastSegment because if it represents\n      // the id, it has been encodeURIComponent-ified within `buildURL`.

When serializing, an option to embed `ids`, `ids-and-types` or `records` can be set.\n      When extracting the only option is `records`.\n       So `{ embedded: 'always' }` is shorthand for:\n      `{ serialize: 'records', deserialize: 'records' }`\n       To embed the `ids` for a related object (using a hasMany relationship):\n       ```app/serializers/post.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data;\n       export default DS.RESTSerializer.extend(DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin, {\n        attrs: {\n          comments: { serialize: 'ids', deserialize: 'records' }\n        }\n      })\n      ```\n       ```js\n      {\n        \"post\": {\n          \"id\": \"1\"\n          \"title\": \"Rails is omakase\",\n          \"body\": \"I want this for my ORM, I want that for my template language...\"\n          \"comments\": [\"1\", \"2\"]\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n       To embed the relationship as a collection of objects with `id` and `type` keys, set\n      `ids-and-types` for the related object.\n       This is particularly useful for polymorphic relationships where records don't share\n      the same table and the `id` is not enough information.\n       For example having a user that has many pets:\n       ```js\n      User = DS.Model.extend({\n        name:    DS.attr('string'),\n        pets: DS.hasMany('pet', { polymorphic: true })\n      });\n       Pet = DS.Model.extend({\n        name: DS.attr('string'),\n      });\n       Cat = Pet.extend({\n        // ...\n      });\n       Parrot = Pet.extend({\n        // ...\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/serializers/user.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data;\n       export default DS.RESTSerializer.extend(DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin, {\n        attrs: {\n          pets: { serialize: 'ids-and-types', deserialize: 'records' }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```js\n      {\n        \"user\": {\n          \"id\": \"1\"\n          \"name\": \"Bertin Osborne\",\n          \"pets\": [\n            { \"id\": \"1\", \"type\": \"Cat\" },\n            { \"id\": \"1\", \"type\": \"Parrot\"}\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n       @method serializeHasMany\n      @param {DS.Snapshot} snapshot\n      @param {Object} json\n      @param {Object} relationship\n    */\n    serializeHasMany: function serializeHasMany(snapshot, json, relationship) {\n      var attr = relationship.key;\n      if (this.noSerializeOptionSpecified(attr)) {\n        this._super(snapshot, json, relationship);\n        return;\n      }\n\n      if (this.hasSerializeIdsOption(attr)) {\n        var serializedKey = this._getMappedKey(relationship.key, snapshot.type);\n        if (serializedKey === relationship.key && this.keyForRelationship) {\n          serializedKey = this.keyForRelationship(relationship.key, relationship.kind, 'serialize');\n        }\n\n        json[serializedKey] = snapshot.hasMany(attr, { ids: true });\n      } else if (this.hasSerializeRecordsOption(attr)) {\n        this._serializeEmbeddedHasMany(snapshot, json, relationship);\n      } else {\n        if (this.hasSerializeIdsAndTypesOption(attr)) {\n          this._serializeHasManyAsIdsAndTypes(snapshot, json, relationship);\n        }\n      }\n    },\n\n\n    /*\n      Serializes a hasMany relationship as an array of objects containing only `id` and `type`\n      keys.\n      This has its use case on polymorphic hasMany relationships where the server is not storing\n      all records in the same table using STI, and therefore the `id` is not enough information\n       TODO: Make the default in Ember-data 3.0??\n    */\n    _serializeHasManyAsIdsAndTypes: function _serializeHasManyAsIdsAndTypes(snapshot, json, relationship) {\n      var serializedKey = this.keyForAttribute(relationship.key, 'serialize');\n      var hasMany = snapshot.hasMany(relationship.key);\n\n      json[serializedKey] = Ember.A(hasMany).map(function (recordSnapshot) {\n        //\n        // I'm sure I'm being utterly naive here.

This is the method you most likely want to subclass.\n      - `extractId` | `extractAttributes` | `extractRelationships` - `normalize` delegates to these methods to\n        turn the record payload into the JSON API format.\n  \n    @class JSONSerializer\n    @namespace DS\n    @extends DS.Serializer\n  */\n  var JSONSerializer = _serializer.default.extend({\n    /**\n      The `primaryKey` is used when serializing and deserializing\n      data.
